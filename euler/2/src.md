# Problem Statement

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
\begin{equation}
	1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89,\ldots
\end{equation}
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed $N$, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

# My Algorithm

For the Project Euler problem, $N = 4\times10^6$.
Let's list the Fibonacci numbers with $F(0) = 0$:
\begin{equation}
	0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,\ldots
\end{equation}
Using the definition of the Fibonacci sequence:
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		F(n+3) &= F(n + 2) + F(n + 1) \\
		&= F(n + 1) + F(n) + F(n + 1) \\
		&= 2F(n + 1) + F(n).
	\end{split}
	\label{fib-sum}
\end{equation}
This shows that if $F(n)$ is even, then so is $F(n+3)$.
Because $F(0) = 0$ is even, then the even Fibonacci numbers are $F(3k)$ for positive integers $k$.

Further applying the Fibonacci recurrence relation gives
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		F(3k) &= 2F(3k - 2) + F(3k - 3) \\
		&= 3F(3k - 3) + 2F(3k - 4) \\
		&= 3F(3k - 3) + 2F(3k - 5) + 2F(3k - 6).
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
From \eqref{fib-sum}, we have $F(3k - 3) = 2F(3k - 5) + F(3k - 6)$, so
\begin{equation}
	F(3k) = 4F(3k - 3) + F(3k - 6) = 4F(3(k-1)) + F(3(k-2)).
	\label{next-fib}
\end{equation}
To solve the problem, we begin with $0,2$.
Using \eqref{next-fib}, we add to a sum the next even Fibonacci number, keeping track of the last two even Fibonacci numbers.
We continue this until the next even Fibonacci number exceeds $N$.
This solution performs one-third as many steps as there are Fibonacci numbers up to $N$, so it is $O(\log n)$.

## Other Solutions
The optimization of only computing even Fibonacci numbers does not change the time complexity of the solution, but it does lend an improvement by a constant factor of 3.
Without this optimization, the solution is still $O(\log n)$.
Because there are only 28 even Fibonacci numbers under $4 \times 10^{16}$, preprocessing can be used to find the prefix sums of the even Fibonacci numbers.
This solution is $O(1)$.

## Mathematical Solution
A more mathematically oriented $O(1)$ solution (my personal favourite) is also possible.
Unfortunately, the floating point calculations involved become too inaccurate with large values of $N$, and using a high precision floating point library (such as Python's `decimal`) is too slow.
Regardless, a famous formula for the value of the $n$-th Fibonacci number is [Binet's formula](../../fib-ext/):
\begin{equation}
	F(n) = \frac{\varphi^n - (-\varphi)^{-n}}{\sqrt{5}}.
\end{equation}

Suppose we know that we need to sum the Fibonacci numbers $F(3k)$ for integers $k$ from 0 to some maximum $M$ to get our desired sum $S$.
Then we have two geometric series:
\begin{equation}
	S = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left(\sum_{k=0}^M \varphi^{3k} - \sum_{k=0}^M (-\varphi)^{-(3k)}\right).
	\label{sum}
\end{equation}
We can find the first term of each series by setting $k = 0$; they are both 1.
In the first series, the common ratio is $\varphi^3$, in the second $(-\varphi)^{-3}$.
We use the formula for the [sum of a geometric series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series#Formula) with first term $a$ and common ratio $r$ with $n$ terms:
\begin{equation}
	a + ar + ar^3 + \cdots + ar^{n-1} = a\left(\frac{r^n - 1}{r-1}\right).
\end{equation}
Now we can rewrite \eqref{sum}, noting that each sum contains the first $M+1$ terms of a geometric series:
\begin{equation}
	S = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left( \frac{\varphi^{3(M+1)} - 1}{\varphi^3 - 1} + \frac{(-\varphi)^{-3(M+1)} - 1}{\varphi^{-3} + 1} \right).
	\label{sum2}
\end{equation}
It's nice to have from a mathematical point of view, but the second term in \eqref{sum2} quickly vanishes.
Excluding it gives an absolute error of less than 1, so we can ignore it and floor the expression:
\begin{equation}
	S = \left\lfloor \frac{\varphi^{3(M+1)} - 1}{\sqrt{5}(\varphi^3 - 1)} \right\rfloor.
\end{equation}

Now we need to find what this maximum $M$ actually is.
We know that $F(3M)$ is the largest even Fibonacci number less than or equal to $N$.
Using the truncated version of Binet's formula, we know that
\begin{equation}
	F(n) \approx \frac{\varphi^n}{\sqrt{5}},
\end{equation}
so $n \approx \log_\varphi(\sqrt{5} F(n))$.
Therefore, $M \approx \left\lfloor\frac{1}{3}\log_\varphi(N\sqrt{5})\right\rfloor$.
And so our desired answer is
\begin{equation}
	S = \left\lfloor \frac{\varphi^{3\left(\left\lfloor\frac{1}{3}\log_\varphi(N\sqrt{5})\right\rfloor+1\right)} - 1}{\sqrt{5}(\varphi^3 - 1)} \right\rfloor.
\end{equation}
