## Problem Statement {#problem-statement}

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two
terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

\begin{equation\*}
	1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89,\ldots
\end{equation\*}

Find the sum of the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence not exceeding \\(N\\).


## My Algorithm {#my-algorithm}

For the Project Euler problem, \\(N = 4\times10^6\\). Let's list the Fibonacci
numbers with \\(F(0) = 0\\):

\begin{equation}
	0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,\ldots
\end{equation}

Using the definition of the Fibonacci sequence:

\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		F(n+3) &= F(n + 2) + F(n + 1) \\\\\\
		&= F(n + 1) + F(n) + F(n + 1) \\\\\\
		&= 2F(n + 1) + F(n).
	\end{split}
	\label{fib-sum}
\end{equation}

This shows that if \\(F(n)\\) is even, then so is \\(F(n+3)\\). Because \\(F(0) = 0\\) is
even, then the even Fibonacci numbers are \\(F(3k)\\) for positive integers \\(k\\).

Further applying the Fibonacci recurrence relation gives

\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		F(3k) &= 2F(3k - 2) + F(3k - 3) \\\\\\
		&= 3F(3k - 3) + 2F(3k - 4) \\\\\\
		&= 3F(3k - 3) + 2F(3k - 5) + 2F(3k - 6).
	\end{split}
\end{equation}

From \eqref{fib-sum}, we have \\(F(3k - 3) = 2F(3k - 5) + F(3k - 6)\\), so

\begin{equation}
	F(3k) = 4F(3k - 3) + F(3k - 6) = 4F(3(k-1)) + F(3(k-2)).
	\label{next-fib}
\end{equation}

To solve the problem, we begin with \\(0,2\\). Using \eqref{next-fib}, we add to a
sum the next even Fibonacci number, keeping track of the last two even Fibonacci
numbers. We continue this until the next even Fibonacci number exceeds \\(N\\). This
solution performs one-third as many steps as there are Fibonacci numbers up to
\\(N\\), so it is \\(O(\log n)\\).


### Other Solutions {#other-solutions}

Only computing even Fibonacci numbers does not change the
time complexity of the solution, but it does shave off a constant factor of 3.


### Mathematical Solution {#mathematical-solution}

A more mathematically oriented \\(O(1)\\) solution (my personal favourite) is also
possible. Unfortunately, the floating point calculations involved become too
inaccurate with large values of \\(N\\), and using a high precision floating point
library (such as Python's `decimal`) is too slow. Regardless, a famous formula
for the value of the $n$-th Fibonacci number is Binet's formula:

\begin{equation}
	F(n) = \frac{\varphi^n - (-\varphi)^{-n}}{\sqrt{5}}.
\end{equation}

Suppose we know that we need to sum the Fibonacci numbers \\(F(3k)\\) for integers
\\(k\\) from 0 to some maximum \\(M\\) to get our desired sum \\(S\\). Then we have two
geometric series:

\begin{equation}
	S = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left(\sum\_{k=0}^M \varphi^{3k} - \sum\_{k=0}^M (-\varphi)^{-(3k)}\right).
	\label{sum}
\end{equation}

We can find the first term of each series by setting \\(k = 0\\); they are both 1.
In the first series, the common ratio is \\(\varphi^3\\), in the second
\\((-\varphi)^{-3}\\). We use the formula for the [sum of a geometric series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric%5Fseries#Formula) with
first term \\(a\\) and common ratio \\(r\\) with \\(n\\) terms:

\begin{equation}
	a + ar + ar^3 + \cdots + ar^{n-1} = a\left(\frac{r^n - 1}{r-1}\right).
\end{equation}

Now we can rewrite \eqref{sum}, noting that each sum contains the first \\(M+1\\)
terms of a geometric series:

\begin{equation}
	S = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left( \frac{\varphi^{3(M+1)} - 1}{\varphi^3 - 1} + \frac{(-\varphi)^{-3(M+1)} - 1}{\varphi^{-3} + 1} \right).
	\label{sum2}
\end{equation}

It's nice to have from a mathematical point of view, but the second term in
\eqref{sum2} quickly vanishes. Excluding it gives an absolute error of less than
1, so we can ignore it and floor the expression:

\begin{equation}
	S = \left\lfloor \frac{\varphi^{3(M+1)} - 1}{\sqrt{5}(\varphi^3 - 1)} \right\rfloor.
\end{equation}

Now we need to find what this maximum \\(M\\) actually is. We know that \\(F(3M)\\) is
the largest even Fibonacci number less than or equal to \\(N\\). Using the truncated
version of Binet's formula, we know that

\begin{equation}
	F(n) \approx \frac{\varphi^n}{\sqrt{5}},
\end{equation}

so \\(n \approx \log\_\varphi(\sqrt{5} F(n))\\). Therefore, \\(M \approx
\left\lfloor\frac{1}{3}\log\_\varphi(N\sqrt{5})\right\rfloor\\). And so our desired
answer is

\begin{equation}
	S = \left\lfloor \frac{\varphi^{3\left(\left\lfloor\frac{1}{3}\log\_\varphi(N\sqrt{5})\right\rfloor+1\right)} - 1}{\sqrt{5}(\varphi^3 - 1)} \right\rfloor.
\end{equation}
