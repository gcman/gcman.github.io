## Problem Statement {#problem-statement}

For how many values \\(P \le N\\) is there exactly one way to form a right triangle
with integer side lengths and perimeter \\(P\\)?


## My Algorithm {#my-algorithm}

See my solution to [Project Euler 39](../39/), as the techniques I use there are exactly
the ones I use for this problem. The only difference is that we count only
"singular" values of \\(P\\), and we binary search on the index of the greatest
value up to \\(N\\). Our solution has time complexity \\(O(N\_{\text{max}} + T\log
N\_{\text{max}})\\), where \\(T\\) is the number of test cases.
