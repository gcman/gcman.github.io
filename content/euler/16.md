## Problem Statement {#problem-statement}

What is the sum of the digits of \\(2^N\\)?


## My Algorithm {#my-algorithm}

Python has built-in infinite precision integer arithmetic, so this problem is
easily done. We find \\(2^N\\) using built-in modular exponentiation in \\(O(\log N)\\)
time. The length of this number is \\(\lceil N\log\_{10} 2 \rceil \in O(N)\\). And so
our solution has complexity \\(O(N \log N)\\).
