## Problem Statement {#problem-statement}

The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29. What is the largest prime factor of
a given number \\(N\\)?


## My Algorithm {#my-algorithm}

Splitting \\(n\\) into two factors gives one at least \\(\sqrt{n}\\) and one at most
\\(\sqrt{n}\\). To see this, suppose not; if both were strictly less than
\\(\sqrt{n}\\), then their product would be strictly less than \\(n\\), and if both were
strictly greater, so would their product. Of course, \\(n\\) can't be greater than
or less than itself.

This is a very valuable fact. It means that if \\(n\\) is not divisible by a prime
at most \\(\sqrt{n}\\), then \\(n\\) is itself prime. So if we have a list of the primes
under \\(\sqrt{n}\\), and divide \\(n\\) as much as we can by each of them, then what is
left is either 1 or the largest prime factor of \\(n\\). In the first case, the
answer is the largest prime that divided \\(n\\), which we can keep track of.

To generate the list of primes, we can use the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve%5Fof%5FEratosthenes). We start
with a list of the first \\(m\\) numbers. We cross out all the multiples of 2, then
go to the next uncrossed number, and cross out all of its multiples. When we
cannot cross out any more numbers, we are left with the primes less than or
equal to \\(m\\). The time complexity of this operation is \\(O(m\log\log m)\\). There
are about \\(\frac{m}{\log m}\\) primes under \\(m\\), according to the [Prime Number
Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime%5Fnumber%5Ftheorem). In our case, \\(m = \sqrt{n}\\). And so the time complexity of our solution
is \\(O(\sqrt{n}\log \log \sqrt{n} + \frac{\sqrt{n}}{\log n}) = O(\sqrt{n} \log
\log n)\\).


### Other Solutions {#other-solutions}

Because we only need the _largest_ prime factor, an \\(O(\sqrt{n})\\) solution is
possible. The largest factor of \\(n\\) must be prime. So we check whether each
numbers up to \\(\sqrt{n}\\) divides \\(n\\) and keep track of the largest so far that
does, which is our answer. However, the solution above gives more generally
applicable techniques and can also be used to find the $k$-th largest prime
factor.
