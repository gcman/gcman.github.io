## Problem Statement {#problem-statement}

It is possible to show that \\(\sqrt{2}\\) has the following infinite continued
fraction expansion:

\begin{equation\*}
\sqrt{2} = 1 + \frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{2 + \frac{1}{2 + \cdots}}}
\end{equation\*}

By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get the convergents of
\\(\sqrt{2}\\)

\begin{equation\*}
\begin{split}
1 + \frac{1}{2} &= \frac{3}{2} \\\\\\
1 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{1}{2}} &= \frac{7}{5} \\\\\\
1 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{1}{2}}} &= \frac{17}{12} \\\\\\
1 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{1}{2}}}} &= \frac{41}{29}.
\end{split}
\end{equation\*}

The next three convergents are \\(\frac{99}{70},\frac{239}{169}\\), and
\\(\frac{577}{408}\\). However, the eighth convergent, \\(\frac{1393}{985}\\), is the
first for which the number of digits in the numerator exceeds the number of
digits in the denominator. Print the convergent numbers \\(n \le N\\) where this
happens.


## My Algorithm {#my-algorithm}

A common piece of notation for a continued fraction

\begin{equation}
a\_0 + \frac{1}{a\_1 + \frac{1}{a\_2 + \cdots}}
\end{equation}

is \\([a\_0;a\_1,a\_2,\ldots]\\). Because all the coefficients \\(a\_i, i > 1\\) in our case
are 2, the continued fraction expansion for \\(\sqrt{2}\\) is self-similar. In
particular, if one convergent is \\(\frac{p}{q}\\), we can write the next as

\begin{equation}
1 + \frac{1}{1+\frac{p}{q}} = 1 + \frac{q}{p+q} = \frac{p+2q}{p+q}.
\end{equation}

Using this recurrence relation, we can easily compute the convergents and count
which ones have a numerator with more digits than the denominator. This solution
has time complexity \\(O(N)\\).
