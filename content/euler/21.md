## Problem Statement {#problem-statement}

Let \\(d(n)\\) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of \\(n\\) (numbers less than
\\(n\\) that divide evenly into \\(n\\)). If \\(d(a) = b\\) and \\(d(b) = a\\), where \\(a \neq
b\\), then \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are an amicable pair and each of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are amicable
numbers. For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22,
44, 55 and 110; therefore \\(d(220) = 284\\). The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2,
4, 71 and 142; so \\(d(284) = 220\\). Evaluate the sum of the proper divisors under
\\(N\\).


## My Algorithm {#my-algorithm}

The first thing we need is a way to calculate \\(d(n)\\). We only need to check each
number less than \\(\sqrt{n}\\). If it divides \\(n\\), we add it to the sum that we
will return. We therefore find \\(d(n)\\) in \\(O(\sqrt{n})\\) time. Then we can use
preprocessing to answer each query in \\(O(1)\\) time. For each \\(1 \le x \le
N\_{\text{max}}\\), if \\(x = d(d(x))\\) and \\(x \neq d(x)\\), then we add \\(x\\) to a list
of amicable numbers. To answer each query, we simply add the amicable numbers
less than the given \\(N\\). Our solution has time complexity \\(O(N\sqrt{N} + T)\\),
where \\(N\\) is the maximum possible input value and \\(T\\) is the number of queries.
