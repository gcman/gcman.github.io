## Problem Statement {#problem-statement}

In the 20-by-20 grid below, four numbers have been marked in bold.

{{< figure src="/img/euler/11-matrix.png" caption="Figure 1: A nice friendly matrix." >}}

The product of these numbers is \\(26 \cdot 63 \cdot
78 \cdot 14 = 1788696\\). What is the greatest product of four adjacent numbers in
the same direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) in the 20Ã—20 grid?


## My Algorithm {#my-algorithm}

The important thing in this problem is to be careful of boundary conditions. We
start at the top left corner. If there are at least three cells to the right, we
check the horizontal product. If there are at least three cells down, we check
the vertical product. If there are at least three cells to the left and three
cells down, we check the left diagonal product. If there are at least three
cells to the right and three cells down, we check the right diagonal product.
Checking up, left, left-up, or right-up would be redundant. We take the maximum
of these four values and the existing maximum product and set that to be our new
maximum product. We continue like this over all cells in the grid. Our final
answer is found in \\(O(n^2)\\) time---not surprising for a square grid.
