## Problem Statement {#problem-statement}

It is possible to write 10 as the sum of primes in exactly 5 different ways:

\begin{equation\*}
\begin{split}
10 &= 7+3 \\\\\\
&= 5+5 \\\\\\
&= 5+3+2 \\\\\\
&= 2+2+1 \\\\\\
&= 3+3+2+2 \\\\\\
&= 2+2+2+2+2
\end{split}
\end{equation\*}

How many ways can \\(N\\) be written as the sum of primes?


## My Algorithm {#my-algorithm}

Please see my solution to [Project Euler 31](../31/), as we use the same dynamic
programming techniques. This problem is a variant on the coin sum problem in
Euler 31. Here the coins take on the values of the primes up to \\(N\\). There are
about \\(\frac{N}{\log N}\\) primes up to \\(N\\). Our solution has time complexity
\\(O(\frac{N^2}{\log N} + T)\\).
