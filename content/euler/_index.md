Welcome to the homepage of my [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) solutions. Once I solve the original
problem, I also take on the modified version from [ProjectEuler+](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges) on HackerRank,
where the problems usually have multiple, harder test cases. The time limits are
much stricter, and brute force is rarely an option.


## Why do I publish my solutions? {#why-do-i-publish-my-solutions}

After you solve a problem, Project Euler shows the following text:

*We hope that you enjoyed solving this problem. Please do not deprive others of going through the same process by publishing your solution outside Project Euler. If you want to share your insights, then please go to [thread] in the discussion forum.*

I don’t quite agree. As anyone else, I learn the vast majority of what I know
from other people. Someone on my site looking at my solutions decided to look
for help on the greatest source of information we have: the Internet. So I’m
glad to do my part in helping someone else learn.

At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter whether the answer is 27189 or 27819;
the process is what counts, and that’s what I try to share. That’s why I share
my algorithms and code (and the process of coming up with them), but never a big
flashing box with the answer on it.


## How far have I gotten? {#how-far-have-i-gotten}

Here is a complete summary of my progress in solving problems on Project Euler
and their upgraded versions on ProjectEuler+ at HackerRank.
