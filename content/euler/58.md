## Problem Statement {#problem-statement}

Starting with 1 and spiralling clockwise in the following way, a square spiral
with side length 7 is formed.

It is interesting to note that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both
diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of \\(\frac{8}{13} \approx 62\%\\). If one
complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side
length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the side length
of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first
falls below \\(N\%\\)?


## My Algorithm {#my-algorithm}

As shown in my solution to [Project Euler 28](../28/), the corners of a number spiral of size $n$ are of the form $n^2 - i(n-1)$, for \\(i \in \{1,2,3,4\}\\). We
discount the case where \\(i = 4\\), because this is \\((n+2)^2\\). We use the
[Miller-Rabin primality test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin%5Fprimality%5Ftest) to search such numbers and count the primes until
the desired ratio is reached. This solution has time complexity \\(O(N\log^3N)\\),
where \\(N\\) is the maximum side length we must search.
