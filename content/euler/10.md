## Problem Statement {#problem-statement}

The sum of all primes below 10 is \\(2+3+5+7 = 17\\). Find the sum of all primes at
most \\(N\\).


## My Algorithm {#my-algorithm}

We use a Sieve of Eratosthenes to compute the primes up to the maximum possible
value of \\(N\\). We then construct a prefix sum array in \\(O(\frac{N}{\log N})\\)
time. Using a binary search, we find the index of largest prime less than \\(N\\) in
\\(O(\log N - \log \log N)\\) time. In \\(O(1)\\) time, we look up the corresponding
partial sum of prime numbers. Our solution has time complexity \\(O(n\log\log n +
T\log n)\\), where \\(T\\) is the number of queries.
