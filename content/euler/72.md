## Problem Statement {#problem-statement}

The fraction \\(\frac{a}{b}\\) is called a reduced proper fraction if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)
are positive integers with \\(a < b\\) and \\(\mathrm{gcd}(a,b) = 1\\). If we list the
reduced proper fractions for \\(b \le 8\\) in increasing order, we get

\begin{equation\*}
\frac18, \frac17, \frac16, \frac15, \frac14, \frac27, \frac13, \frac38, \frac25, \frac37, \frac12, \frac47, \frac35, \frac58, \frac23, \frac57, \frac34, \frac45, \frac56, \frac67, \frac78
\end{equation\*}

How many elements are contained in the set of reduced proper fractions with
denominator at most \\(N\\)?


## My Algorithm {#my-algorithm}

In order for a fraction to be in reduced form, the numerator and denominator
must be coprime. And so there are \\(\varphi(n)\\) fractions with denominator \\(n\\).
This is true for all \\(n\\) except for 1, which does not contribute any fractions,
because we only consider the elements of \\(\mathbb{Q} \cap (0,1)\\). In total,
there are

\begin{equation}
\sum\limits\_{n=1}^N \varphi(n) - 1
\end{equation}

fractions. We use Euler's product formula for the totient function:

\begin{equation}
\varphi(n) = \prod\limits\_{p|n}\left(1 - \frac{1}{p}\right).
\end{equation}

We can calculate this by using successive subtractions, starting from \\(n\\). For
example, the primes that divide 15 are 3 and 5. This gives \\(15 - \frac{15}{3} =
10 \to 10 - \frac{10}{5} = 8 = \phi(n)\\). We initialize an array `phi` of \\(n\\)
0-entries. This accounts for \\(\varphi(1)\\), which we do not wish to include in
our final count.

Then, we use a method similar to the Sieve of Eratosthenes. If `phi[n] = 0`, we
have not yet dealt with \\(n\\) and its multiples. Because \\(n\\) is prime, we set
`phi[n] = n - 1`. For all other multiples \\(kn < N\\), we account for \\(n\\) being a
prime factor by setting `phi[k/n] = phi[k/n]//n`. Then, we sum the entries of `phi`,
and add 1. To give our final answer, we sum `phi[n]` for all \\(n < N\\). Doing this
once for each test case would have time complexity \\(O(Tn\log\log n)\\). There are
too many test cases for this, so we create a prefix sum array. And so our
solution has time complexity \\(O(n\log\log n + T)\\), where \\(T\\) is the number of
test cases.
