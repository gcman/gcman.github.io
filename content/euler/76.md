## Problem Statement {#problem-statement}

It is possible to write 5 as the sum of at least two positive integers in
exactly 6 different ways:

\begin{equation\*}
\begin{split}
5 &= 4+1 \\\\\\
&= 3+2 \\\\\\
&= 3+1+1 \\\\\\
&= 2+2+1 \\\\\\
&= 2+1+1+1 \\\\\\
&= 1+1+1+1+1
\end{split}
\end{equation\*}

How many ways can \\(N\\) be written as the sum of at least two positive integers?
Report your answer modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).


## My Algorithm {#my-algorithm}

Please see my solution to [Project Euler 31](../31/), as we use the same dynamic
programming techniques. This problem is a variant on the coin sum problem in
Euler 31. This time, the coins have values \\(1,2,\ldots,N\\). At the end, we
subtract 1 to exclude the vacuous sum which is just \\(N\\) itself, and then we
report our answer modulo \\(P\\). Our solution has time complexity \\(O(N^2 + T)\\).
