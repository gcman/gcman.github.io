## Problem Statement {#problem-statement}

By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on
the row below, the maximal total from top to bottom is 23.

Find the maximum path length for a given such triangle.


## My Algorithm {#my-algorithm}

We use a data structure that mimics the structure of a given triangle. For each
row, we update a `parent` array to store the maximal path sums that end in each
entry of the row above. We process each row of the tree into an array called
`current`. For each element `x` in the row, we add to current the sum of `x` and
the maximum of the sums corresponding to the two (or one) entries adjacent to `x`
in the previous row. These sums are found in `parent`. When we finish processing a
row, we set `parent` equal to `current` and continue until all the rows have been
processed. The final answer is the maximal element in `parent`. This solution has
time complexity \\(O(n^2)\\), because we perform an operation for each element of
the triangle.


## Other Solutions {#other-solutions}

A brute force solution is possible for small triangles. The number of paths is
the sum of the number of paths that end in each entry of the bottom row. This is
the sum of the entries in the $n$-th row of Pascal's triangle, or \\(2^n\\). And so
a brute force solution would have time complexity \\(O(2^n)\\).
