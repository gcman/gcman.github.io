## Problem Statement {#problem-statement}

How many, not necessarily distinct, values of \\(\binom{n}{r}\\), for \\(n \le N\\), are
greater than \\(K\\)?


## My Algorithm {#my-algorithm}

A brute-force search is too slow. And so we exploit the symmetry of Pascal's
triangle, which contains the binomial coefficients. Because \\(\binom{n}{k} =
\binom{n}{n-k}\\), we need only check up to \\(\frac{n}{2}\\). Furthermore, if
\\(\binom{n}{k}\\) is the first value greater than \\(K\\), then because the entries of
Pascal's triangle strictly increase until the central term, all the entries
between \\(k\\) and \\(n-k\\), inclusive, will be greater than \\(K\\). This amounts to
\\(n-2k+1\\). We also make use of the recurrence relation

\begin{equation}
\binom{a}{b+1} = \binom{a}{b}\frac{a-b}{b+1},
\end{equation}

as described in my solution to [Project Euler 15](../15/). We iterate through the binomial
coefficients in row \\(n\\) until we find one greater than \\(K\\), say \\(\binom{n}{i}\\).
Then the answer is the sum of \\(n + 1 - 2i\\) for each \\(n \le N\\). This solution has
time complexity \\(O(N^2)\\) (this is really not a tight bound).
