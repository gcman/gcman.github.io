## Problem Statement {#problem-statement}

The $n$-th term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by \\(t\_n =
\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\); so the first ten triangle numbers are

\begin{equation\*}
1,3,6,10,15,21,28,36,45,55,\ldots
\end{equation\*}

By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its
alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For example,
the word value for SKY is \\(19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t\_{10}\\). You are given a file
`words.txt`. Of the English words it contains, how many are triangle words?


## My Algorithm {#my-algorithm}

Let us suppose we have some number \\(t = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\). Then

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
2t &= n(n+1) \\\\\\
2t &= n^2 + n \\\\\\
n^2 + n - 2t &= 0 \\\\\\
n &= \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{8t + 1}}{2}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Because we are solving for positive \\(n\\), we have

\begin{equation}
n = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{8t + 1}}{2}.
\label{n}
\end{equation}

We know that \\(t\\) is a triangle number if and only if \eqref{n} is an integer. To
compute the name scores, we use the same method as in [Project Euler 22](../22/). To finish the
problem, we read in the names, and count them if their score is a triangle
number. The time complexity of this solution is \\(O(n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number
of names.


### HackerRank {#hackerrank}

The HackerRank version of this problem is simpler. It does not involve words.
Instead, it asks whether a number \\(n \le 10^{18}\\) is triangular. We have an
\\(O(1)\\) method of answering this question.
