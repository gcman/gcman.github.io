## Problem Statement {#problem-statement}

Suppose we start at the top-left corner of an \\(N\times M\\) grid and that we can
only travel to the right or down. How many routes are there to the bottom-right
corner? Output the answer modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).


## My Algorithm {#my-algorithm}

In total, we must make \\(N+M\\) moves, of which \\(N\\) are to the right. Choosing
these \\(N\\) moves uniquely identifies each possible route, as this is equivalent
to choosing the \\(M\\) downwards moves. This is a combinatorial explanation for the
fact that

\begin{equation}
\binom{N+M}{N} = \binom{N+M}{M} = \frac{(N+M)!}{N!M!}
\end{equation}

which is our answer. To make the computation easier, we use the smaller of \\(N\\)
and \\(M\\). Suppose we know the value of \\(\binom{a}{b} = \frac{a!}{b!(a-b)!}\\). Then
we can find the value of

\begin{equation}
\binom{a}{b+1} = \frac{a!}{(b+1)!(a-b-1)!} = \binom{a}{b}\frac{a-b}{b+1}
\label{recurrence}
\end{equation}

This gives us a recurrence relation. Because we are computing the answer modulo
\\(10^9 + 7\\), we must use the modular multiplicative inverse of \\(b+1\\). Because the
modulus is prime, this is guaranteed to exist.

Starting with \\(\binom{N+M}{0} = 1\\), we iterate over \\(0 \le k \le
\mathrm{min}(N,M) - 1\\) use the recurrence relation \eqref{recurrence},
multiplying by \\(N + M - k\\) and the modular inverse of \\(k + 1\\) under \\(P\\). At each
step, we take the expression modulo \\(P\\). Our solution has time complexity
\\(O(\mathrm{min}(N,M)\log P)\\).
