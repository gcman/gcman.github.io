## Problem Statement {#problem-statement}

The number 197 is called a circular prime because all rotations of the digits
(197,719,917) are prime. There are thirteen such prime under 100: 2, 3, 5, 7,
11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97. What is the sum of all circular primes
less than \\(N\\)?


## My Algorithm {#my-algorithm}

A permutation of a number \\(n\\) cannot be greater than the smallest power of 10
that is at least \\(n\\). This is because it maintains the same number of digits, and
such a power of 10 contains one more digit than \\(n\\). This means that a
permutation of \\(n\\) is not more than \\(10^{\lceil \log\_{10} n \rceil}\\). And so we
can precompute a list of the primes under \\(10^{\lceil \log\_{10} N\_{\text{max}}
\rceil}\\), which in our case is \\(10^6\\).

Now we need a way to get all the rotations of a number. To do this, we can turn
the number into a string and repeatedly remove the last character and add it
back to the front, saving the new rotation each time. From here, the problem
just consists of spotting some optimizations. We need not check any primes with
digits 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 8. This is because the last digit of one of their
rotations will be either even or 5, which means they are divisible by 2 or 5 and
so they are not prime. However, we must include the single-digit primes 2 and 5,
which are circular. After computing the rotations of a prime below \\(N\\) that
passes the above tests, we check if all of them are prime; if so, we count the
ones that are below \\(N\\). Our solution has time complexity
\\(O(N\_{\text{max}}\log\log N\_{\text{max}})\\).
