## Problem Statement {#problem-statement}

By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on
the row below, the maximal total from top to bottom is 23.

{{< figure src="/img/euler/18-triangle.png" caption="Figure 1: Note that \\(3+7+4+9 = 23\\)." width="100px" >}}

Find the maximum path length for a given such triangle with 100 rows.


## My Algorithm {#my-algorithm}

Please see [Project Euler 18](../18/), which has an identical solution.
