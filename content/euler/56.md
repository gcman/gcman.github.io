## Problem Statement {#problem-statement}

Considering natural numbers \\(a,b \le N\\), which number of the form \\(a^b\\) has the
maximum digital sum?


## My Algorithm {#my-algorithm}

For each \\(a,b \le N\\), we simply compute \\(a^b\\) in \\(\log b\\) time and store its
digital sum if it is maximal so far. This solution has time complexity
\\(O(N^2\log N)\\).
