## Problem Statement {#problem-statement}

By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that
the 6th prime is 13. What is the $N$-th prime number?


## My Algorithm {#my-algorithm}

We use the following identity, which is a consequence of the Prime Number
Theorem:

\begin{equation}
n(\log n + \log \log n - 1) < p\_n < n(\log n + \log \log n), n > 5.
\end{equation}

If \\(n \le 5\\), we use a look-up table. Using a Sieve of Eratosthenes, we generate
a list of the primes up to \\(n(\log n + \log \log n)\\), which is guaranteed to
contain the $n$-th prime. Our answer is the $n$-th element of this array. We do
this with time complexity \\(O(n \log n \log \log (n \log n))\\), using \\(p\_n \approx
n \log n\\). Because \\(O(\log \log (n \log n)) \in O(\log n)\\), this can be
simpified to \\(O(n \log^2 n)\\). To optimize the constant factor, we compute the
first \\(N\_{\text{max}} = 10^4\\) primes and store them in memory, rather than
computing the list for each query, which takes too long.
