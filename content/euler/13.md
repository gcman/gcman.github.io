## Problem Statement {#problem-statement}

Find the first ten digits of the sum of \\(N\\) 50-digit numbers.


## My Algorithm {#my-algorithm}

Thanks to Python's built-in ability to handle infinitely large integers, this
problem is a piece of cake. We read in the numbers, add them, convert the result
to a string, and output the first ten characters.


### Other Solutions {#other-solutions}

In languages without big integer support, we would need an algorithm to add big
integers, using string arrays and the carrying method often taught in elementary
schools.
