## Problem Statement {#problem-statement}

145 is a curious number, as \\(1! + 4! + 5! = 145\\). Find the sum of all numbers
that are the sum of the factorials of their digits. Note that \\(1! = 1\\) and \\(2! =
2\\) are not sums, as they contain only one digit.


## My Algorithm {#my-algorithm}

We use a combinatorial approach similar to [Project Euler 30](../30/). The sum of the factorials
of the digits of a number with \\(d\\) digits is \\(d\cdot9!\\). So the upper bound on
the number we need to check is \\(7\cdot9!\\), because \\(8\cdot9!\\) only has 7 digits.
This means we can test valid candidate sets of size \\(2 \le k \le 7\\) chosen with
replacement from \\(0!,\ldots,9!\\). Like in Project Euler 30, we use multisets to check
whether a combination is valid. And so we perform

\begin{equation}
\sum\limits\_{k=2}^{7} \mkern-5mu \binom{9+k}{k} = 19347
\label{operations}
\end{equation}

operations, as in Project Euler 30.


### HackerRank {#hackerrank}

The HackerRank problem is, for once, much easier than the original Project Euler
problem. It asks us to find the sum of all \\(n < N\\) such that \\(n\\) divides its
factorial digit sum. Because \\(N \le 10^5\\), we can run a brute force search,
checking whether each \\(n < N\\) is a valid solution.
