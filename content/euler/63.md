## Problem Statement {#problem-statement}

The five-digit number \\(16807 = 7^5\\) is also a fifth power. Given \\(N\\), find the
$N$-digit positive integers that are also an $N$-th power.


## My Algorithm {#my-algorithm}

An $n$-digit $n$-th power has $n$-th root at most 9, because \\(10^n\\) is an
$(n+1)$-digit number. If \\(a^n\\) is an $n$-digit number, then unless \\(a = 9\\), we
also have that \\((a+1)^n\\) is an $n$-digit number. We must find the lowest \\(a\\)
such that \\(a^n\\) has \\(n\\) digits. We have

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
10^{n-1} &\le a^n < 10^{n} \\\\\\
10^{1-\frac{1}{n}} &\le a < 10 \\\\\\
a &= \lceil10^{1-\frac{1}{n}}\rceil.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

And so \\(k^n\\) is an $n$-digit number for all \\(k \in
[\lceil10^{1-\frac{1}{n}}\rceil,9]\\). We enumerate these in \\(O(1)\\) time.
