The Fibonacci numbers are probably the most well-known sequence in mathematics (of course, not including something like 0,1,2,...).
They have the property that each term is the sum of the two previous terms, and the first two terms are 0 and 1:
\begin{equation}
	0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,\ldots
\end{equation}
This sequence is deeply connected with the golden ratio
\begin{equation}
	\varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 1.618034.
\end{equation}
For example, the ratio of the $n$-th Fibonacci number with the one before it tends to $\varphi$ as $n$ gets very large.
