summary: My solution to problem 13 of Project Euler.

# Problem Statement
Find the first ten digits of the sum of $N$ 50-digit numbers.

# My Algorithm

Thanks to Python's built-in ability to handle infinitely large integers, this problem is a piece of cake.
We read in the numbers, add them, convert the result to a string, and output the first ten characters.

## Other Solutions

In languages without big integer support, then we would have to write an algorithm to add big integers, using string arrays and the carrying method often taught in elementary schools.
