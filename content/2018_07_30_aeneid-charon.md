summary: A poetic rendition of some lines from book 6 of Vergil's Aeneid.

| portitor has horrendus aquas et flumina servat
| terribili squalore Charon, cui plurima mento
| canities inculta iacet, stant lumina flamma, 
| sordidus ex umeris nodo dependet amictus.
| ipse ratem conto subigit velisque ministrat
| et ferruginea subvectat corpora cumba,
| iam senior, sed cruda deo viridisque senectus.
| huc omnis turba ad ripas effusa ruebat, 
| matres atque viri defunctaque corpora vita
| magnanimum heroum, pueri innuptaeque puellae,
| impositique rogis iuvenes ante ora parentum:
| quam multa in silvis autumni frigore primo
| lapsa cadunt folia, aut ad terram gurgite ab alto 
| quam multae glomerantur aves, ubi frigidus annus
| trans pontum fugat et terris immittit apricis.
| stabant orantes primi transmittere cursum
| tendebantque manus ripae ulterioris amore.
| navita sed tristis nunc hos nunc accipit illos, 
| ast alios longe summotos arcet harena.

| Horrendous is the ferryman who guards
| upon these waters---Charon, foully clothed,
| dreadful, a mass of uncomb'd grey out from
| his chin. His eyes stand on his face like flames
| alight. A sordid mantle knotted from
| his shoulder falls. Alone he guides the raft
| by pole, maintains the sails, transports the dead
| all on his rusty barge. Already old,
| but to a god old age is blooming green.
| Whole crowds burst out, cascading to these banks.
| Down tumble husbands and their wives; behind 
| them follow high-souled heroes done with life; 
| and maidens fair and boys placed on the pyre
| before their parents' eyes: so many dead.
| As many as the forest's fallen leaves 
| on autumn's maiden frost. As many as
| the birds that flock together, sent across
| the raging deep by frigid months in search
| of sun-struck lands. They stood beseeching spots
| on the initial voyage, stretching out
| their hands in yearning for the banks beyond.
| Yet this dejected boatman grimly takes
| now these, now those, and holds the others back,
| retained and kept a distance from the sand.
