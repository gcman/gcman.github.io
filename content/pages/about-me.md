title: About Me

Hi, I'm Gautam Manohar.
If you're voraciously curious, naturally skeptical, or just unabashedly nerdy, then great!
You're in the right place.

I love mathematics, and I learn about computer science and chemistry on the side.
Interesting ideas come from all walks of life: academic subjects, learning a new language, meeting new people, or idle musings over a good cup of tea.
Such ideas give my life colour and promise to occupy me for a lifetime.
My favourite question is ``Why?'' and my favourite number is 7, but it perhaps should be $n$: why consider one when you can consider them all?

In my spare time, I enjoy practicing handwriting and calligraphy, playing table tennis, and watching basketball.
