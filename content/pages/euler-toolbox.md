title: Project Euler Toolbox
slug: euler/toolbox
summary: My toolbox of fully commented Python code snippets that I use on a regular basis.

Welcome to my ``toolbox.''
This page is a repository of code snippets and algorithms that I keep using in my Project Euler solutions.
Each snippet aims to be self-contained.
As a result, I do not import a personal `euler` package or something of the sort when writing my solutions.
I aim to explain each algorithm and my implementation of it (or cite helpful sources if the algorithm is not my own).
