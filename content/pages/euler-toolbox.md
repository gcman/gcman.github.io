title: Project Euler Toolbox
slug: euler/toolbox
summary: My toolbox of fully commented Python code snippets that I use on a regular basis.

Welcome to my "toolbox."
This page is a repository of code snippets and algorithms that I frequently use in my Project Euler solutions.
Each snippet aims to be self-contained.
Because of this, I do not import a personal `euler` package (or something of the sort) when writing my solutions.
I aim to explain each algorithm and my implementation of it (or cite helpful sources if the algorithm is not my own).
