summary: "Which is greater: e^pi or pi^e? I solve this puzzle with differentiation, Taylor series, concavity, and the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality."

The constants $e$ and $\pi$ are everywhere in mathematics.
Determining the greater of the two expressions $e^\pi$ and $\pi^e$ (without using a calculator, of course...) is a fun puzzle that you can approach in many ways.
I'd like to discuss my solutions.

# Differentiation
We shall perform the same operations on the two expressions:
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		e^\pi &\odot \pi^e \\
		e^{\frac{\pi}{e}} &\odot \pi^{\frac{e}{e}} \\
		e^{\frac{1}{e}} &\odot \pi^{\frac{1}{\pi}}.
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
To show that $e^\pi > \pi^e$, it suffices to show that $e^{\frac{1}{e}} > \pi^{\frac{1}{\pi}}$.
Let $y = x^{\frac{1}{x}}$.
Then we can implicitly differentiate to find the critical points.
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		\ln{y} &= \ln{x^{\frac{1}{x}}} \\
		\ln{y} &= \frac{\ln{x}}{x} \\
		\diff{}{x}\ln{y} &= \diff{}{x}\frac{\ln{x}}{x} \\
		\frac{1}{y}y' &= \frac{x\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) - \ln{x}\cdot1}{x^2} \\
		y' &= x^{\frac{1}{x}}\frac{1 - \ln{x}}{x^2}.
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
The expressions $x^{\frac{1}{x}}$ and $x^2$ are always positive, so there is only critical point: when $1 - \ln{x} = 0$, or when $x = e$.
We must find whether this point is a global minimum or a maximum.
When $x = 1 < e$, we have $1 - \ln{x} = 1$, so the function is increasing.
The value $x = e^2 > e$ gives $1 - \ln{x} = -1$, which means the function is decreasing.
Thus $x^{\frac{1}{x}}$ has a global maximum at $x = e$.
And so $e^{\frac{1}{e}} > \pi^{\frac{1}{\pi}}$, which shows that $e^\pi > \pi^e$.

# Inequality
If we use the inequality $1 + x < e^x$ (I will present three proofs of this below), then a very simple solution presents itself.
The equality holds for all $x$, but we only require it to hold for positive $x$.
Make the substitution $x = \frac{\pi}{e} - 1$, in an effort to cancel out the 1 on the right side of the inequality and introduce $\pi$.
Because $\pi>e$, $\frac{\pi}{e} - 1 > 0$, and so
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		1 + \frac{\pi}{e} - 1 &< e^{\frac{\pi}{e} - 1} \\
		\pi\cdot\frac{1}{e} &< e^{\frac{\pi}{e}} \cdot \frac{1}{e} \\
		\pi &< e^{\frac{\pi}{e}}\\
		\pi^e &< e^\pi.
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
Wonderful, isn't it?

## Taylor Series
This is the most standard proof I have; I think it's the least exciting.
We only prove the equality for positive $x$.
We know
\begin{equation}
	e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots
\end{equation}
Thus for $x > 0$, all the terms on the right side will be positive, and so $e^x > 1 + x$.

## Concavity
This method requires a little more "geometric intuition" than the last.
At $x = 0$, we have $e^x = 1$.
At this point $(0,1)$, the tangent line to $e^x$ has slope $1$ and has the equation $y = 1 + x$.
Because $(e^x)'' = e^x > 0$, $e^x$ is always concave up, so it is always above its tangent line.
Therefore, $1 + x < e^x$.

## AM-GM
This is my favourite proof.
It's a little less intuitive than the others, but I think it's beautiful.
We use the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality.
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		\sqrt[n]{1+x} &= \sqrt[n]{\smash[b]{\underbrace{1\cdot1\cdots1}_{\text{$n-1$ times}}\cdot(1+x)}} \\[1em]
		&\le \frac{\overbrace{1+\dotsb+1}^{\text{$n-1$ times}}}{n} \\
		&= \frac{\overbrace{1+\dotsb+1}^{\text{$n-1$ times}}+(1+x)}{n} \\
		&= \frac{\overbrace{1+\dotsb+1}^{\text{$n$ times}}+x}{n} \\
		&= 1 + \frac{x}{n}.
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
Strict equality in the AM-GM inequality only holds when all the terms are equal.
In this case, $x > 0$, so $1 + x \neq 1$, so we have strict inequality.
This gives $\sqrt[n]{1+x} < 1 + \frac{x}{n}$.
Raising both sides to the $n$-th power gives
\begin{equation}
	1 + x < \left(1 + \frac{x}{n}\right)^n.
\end{equation}
Taking the limit as $n$ approaches $\infty$ on both sides yields
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		\lim_{n\to\infty} (1 + x) &< \lim_{n\to\infty} \left(1 + \frac{x}{n}\right)^n \\
		1 + x &< e^x.
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
Using the limit definition of $e$, we conclude our proof.

I get the feeling that there are many other ways to attack this problem. If you can solve it with a method that I have not shown, please let me know!
