# Problem Statement

An irrational decimal is created by concatenating the positive integers:
\begin{equation*}
	0.12345678910\mathbf{1}112131415161718192021\ldots
\end{equation*}
It can be seen that the 12th digit of the fractional part is `1`.
If $d_n$ represents the $n$-th digit of the fractional part, then given integers $i_j$, find the product of $d_{i_j}$.

# My Algorithm

We can split up the fractional part into "blocks" where each positive integer used has the same number of digits.
For example, starting at zero, the zeroth block is `123456789`, the first `101112...9899`, and so on.
The numbers used to make up the $n$-th block (where the first block is $n = 0$) range from $10^n$ to $10^{n+1} - 1$, inclusive.
There are therefore $10^{n+1} - 10^n = 9\cdot10^n$ numbers in the $n$-th block.
Because each number in the $n$-th block has $n+1$ digits, the $n$-th block is $9(n+1)10^n$ digits long.

We initialize `block` at 1.
This means `block` is equal to $n+1$.
It represents the number of digits in each integer in the block that $d_i$ is part of.
We initialize `fact` at 9.
It represents the number of positive integers that make up `block`.
This means `fact*block` represents the length of `block`.
Then, as long as the result is positive and `fact * block` is less than $9M$, where $M$ is the maximum possible value of $i$ in $d_i$ (a hard upper bound on the length of the largest block, given the input constraints), we subtract `fact*block` from the given $d_i$.
Then, we multiply `fact` by 10, representing the ten-fold increase in the number of elements of the next block, and increment `block` by 1, representing the fact that we are moving to the next block.
The resulting value of `block` is the block in which $d_i$ is located.
The resulting value of $d_i$ is `pos+1`, where `pos` is the zero-indexed "position" of $d_i$ in its block; that is, $d_i$ is the `pos`-th digit in its block.

Because $d_i$ is in the block given by `block`, the first number in its block is `10**(block-1)`.
Each number in this block has `block` digits.
And so `pos//block` gives the number of positive integers that precede the integer $d_i$ is part of in its block.
This means $d_i$ is part of the positive integer `10**(block-1) + pos//block`
The leftover after this division (that is, `pos % block`) is the index (starting at 0) of $d_i$ in the number it is part of.
Because we know the number that $d_i$ is part of, we have solved the problem.
Using our general procedure, we find $d_{i_{j}}$ and calculate their product.

The most intensive part of our solution is finding the block that $d_i$ is part of; finding the value of $d_i$ after this is just an $O(1)$ string operation.
The lengths of the blocks form an arithmetogeometric sequence, so there are $O(\log n)$ blocks (not a tight upper bound).
And so our solution has time complexity $O(D\log i_{j_{\text{max}}})$, where $D$ is the number of digits to find.
