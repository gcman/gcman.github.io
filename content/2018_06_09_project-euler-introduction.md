# Introduction

Welcome to the homepage of my [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) solutions.
Once I solve the original problem, I also take on the modified version from [ProjectEuler+](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges) on Hackerrank, where the problems usually have multiple, harder test cases.
The time limits are much stricter, and brute force is rarely an option.
I like these problems because to solve them, you have to be clever with not only a good mathematical understanding but also an efficient use of algorithms.
