      <description>Problem Statement Given the first \(k\) terms of a sequence, it is impossible to say what the next one will be, as there are infinitely many polynomial functions that interpolate (that is, go through) each of these \(k\) points.
As an example, consider the perfect cubes \(1,8,27,64,\ldots\), given by \(P(n) = n^3\). We try to find an interpolating polynomial, operating by the principle of &amp;ldquo;simpler is better.&amp;rdquo; If we were given just the first term, the simplest possibility is that the sequence is constant.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement It is easily proved that there exists no equilateral triangle with integral side lengths and integral area. Define an almost equilateral triangle as an isoceles triangle in which the third side length differs from the others by one. Some almost equilateral triangles have an integral area. One example is \((5,5,6)\) which has an area of 12.
Find the sum of the perimeters of all almost equilateral triangles with integral side lengths and integral area whose perimeters are at most \(N\).</description>

      <description>Problem Statement The fraction \(\frac{a}{b}\) is called a reduced proper fraction if \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers with \(a &amp;lt; b\) and \(\mathrm{gcd}(a,b) = 1\). If we list the reduced proper fractions for \(b \le 8\) in increasing order, we get
\begin{equation*} \frac18, \frac17, \frac16, \frac15, \frac14, \frac27, \frac13, \frac38, \frac25, \frac37, \frac12, \frac47, \frac35, \frac58, \frac23, \frac57, \frac34, \frac45, \frac56, \frac67, \frac78 \end{equation*}
It can be seen that \(\frac25\) is the fraction immediately to the left of \(\frac37\).</description>

      <description>Problem Statement The constant \(e\) can be written as the infinite continued fraction \([2;1,2,1,\,1,4,1,\,1,6,1,\ldots,1,2k,\ldots]\). Find the sum of the digits in the $N$-th convergent of the continued fraction expansion for \(e\).
A Recurrence Relation We will show the following theorem. Let the the $n$-th convergent of a continued fraction \([a_0;a_1,a_2,\ldots]\) be \(\frac{P_n}{Q_n}\). Then the $(n+1)$-th convergent is
\begin{equation} \frac{a_{n+1}P_n + P_{n-1}}{a_{n+1}Q_{n} + Q_{n-1}}. \end{equation}
We use induction. Because the 0-th convergent is \(a_0\), we define \(P_0 = a_0, Q_0 = 1\).</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Euler&amp;rsquo;s totient function, \(\varphi(n)\), counts the number of positive integers less than \(n\) that are coprime to \(n\).
  Figure 1: Note that \(\frac{n}{\varphi(n)}\) takes on a maximum at \(n = 6\) in the range of this table.
  Given \(N\), find the smallest value \(n&amp;lt;N\) such that \(\frac{n}{\varphi(n)}\) achieves a maximum.
My Algorithm We use Euler&amp;rsquo;s product formula for the totient function,
\begin{equation} \varphi(n) = n\prod\limits_{p|n}\left(1 - \frac{1}{p}\right), \end{equation}</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Surprisingly, there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:
\begin{equation*} \begin{split} 1634 &amp;amp;= 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4 \\
8208 &amp;amp;= 8^4 + 2^4 + 0^4 + 8^4 \\
9474 &amp;amp;= 9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4 \end{split} \end{equation*}
Note that because \(1 = 1^4\) is not a sum, it is not included. The sum of these numbers is \(11634 + 8208 + 9474 = 9316\).</description>

      <description>Problem Statement A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, \(\mathrm{dabc}\) is a permutation of the word \(\mathrm{abcd}\). If the permutations are listed alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order. The lexicographic permutations of \(\mathrm{abc}\) are:
\begin{equation*} \mathrm{abc}, \mathrm{acb}, \mathrm{bac}, \mathrm{bca}, \mathrm{cab}, \mathrm{cba}. \end{equation*}
What is the $N$-th lexicographic permutation of the word \(\mathrm{abcdefghijklm}\)?
My Algorithm Suppose our word has \(n\) letters. Then the first \((n-1)!\) lexicographic permutations begin with \(a\), the next \((n-1)!</description>

      <description>Problem Statement What is the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain \(N\) digits?
My Algorithm We will use Binet&amp;rsquo;s formula for the $n$-th fibonacci number
\begin{equation} F_n = \frac{\varphi^n - (-\varphi)^{-n}}{\sqrt{5}}. \end{equation}
The \((-\varphi)^{-n}\) quickly becomes negligible. So we can make the approximation
\begin{equation} F_n \approx \frac{\varphi^n}{\sqrt{5}}. \label{approx} \end{equation}
A number \(n\) has \(\lfloor \log_{10} n \rfloor + 1\) digits. So we must solve the following equation such that \(n\) is minimized:</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
\begin{equation*} 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89,\ldots \end{equation*}
Find the sum of the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence not exceeding \(N\).

      <description>Problem Statement A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, \(a &amp;lt; b &amp;lt; c\), for which,
\begin{equation*} a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \end{equation*}
For example, \(3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52\). Given \(N\), find the maximal product \(abc\) such that \(a,b,c\) form a Pythagorean triplet for which \(a+b+c = N\). If no such triplet exists, output \(-1\).

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below \(n\).

      <description>Introduction In this post, we will investigate the infinite series
\begin{equation} \sum_{p} \frac{1}{p}, \end{equation}
taken over all primes \(p\). In particular, we will show that this series diverges.
Calculus and the Prime Number Theorem First, we&amp;rsquo;ll show that this problem falls to the incredible might of the following inequalty, which bounds the value of the $n$-th prime:
\begin{equation} n\log n - n \log\log n \le p_n \le n\log n + n\log\log n \quad (n &amp;gt; 5) \end{equation}</description>

      <description>Say you choose two integers. What&amp;rsquo;s the chance that they&amp;rsquo;re coprime? My intuition says that it can&amp;rsquo;t be more than one-half, because half of all numbers share a factor of 2. But I&amp;rsquo;m thoroughly wrong here. The probability is actually \(\frac{6}{\pi^2}\), which is about \(61\%\).
We wish to find the probability that two randomly selected integers \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime. If this is true, then \(\mathrm{gcd}(m,n) = 1\). Let&amp;rsquo;s say that \(p = \mathrm{P}(\mathrm{gcd}(m,n)=1)\).</description>

      <description>Mathematics students are often told not to carelessly extrapolate small sample sizes into general claims. Indeed, this is a general truth of life: isolated examples do not constitute general proof. Say you wanted to convince me of a fact about numbers. You could show me that your fact was true for all numbers up to ten, a hundred, a million, or to whatever ridiculously huge number you could think of&amp;mdash;but it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t constitute a mathematical proof.</description>

      <description>Every triangle can be circumscribed by a circle, because a circle can always be drawn through three given points, so long as they are not colinear. In fact, every triangle also has a circle that is inscribed in it. These two circles are called the triangle&amp;rsquo;s circumcircle and incircle. Finding these circles for a triangle is simple if the triangle is equilateral, a bit harder if it is right-angled, and a bit harder still if it is not.</description>

      <description>One of my favourite formulas in mathematics is the one for the area of a circle, \(\pi r^2\). Its simplicity intrigued my young mind; the circle is, in a sense, the simplest, the roundest shape, and this formula seems to encapsulate the circle&amp;rsquo;s aura of &amp;ldquo;completion.&amp;rdquo; As I grew older, I learned more such formulas for the volumes and surface areas of familiar geometric objects. In particular, I learned of the formula for the volume of a sphere \(\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\).</description>

      <description>The $n$-th harmonic number is defined as the sum of reciprocals of the first \(n\) natural numbers:
\begin{equation} \sum\limits_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k}. \end{equation}
We wish to prove the following identity involving harmonic numbers and binomial coefficients:
\begin{equation} \sum\limits_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k} = -\sum\limits_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k}\binom{n}{k}(-1)^k. \label{identity} \end{equation}
I have two solutions: one with calculus, and one by induction.
Calculus First, we notice that
\begin{equation} \int_0^1 x^{k-1} \d x = \frac{x^k}{k} \Biggr\rvert_0^1 = \frac{1}{k} - \frac{0}{k} = \frac{1}{k}.</description>

      <description>A well-known fact in Euclidean geometry is the following expression for the area of a triangle given its side lengths:
\begin{equation} A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}, \end{equation}
where \(s\) is the semiperimeter of the triangle, \(\frac{a+b+c}{2}\). Our goal is to generalize this formula to quadrilaterals. Just like in proofs of Heron&amp;rsquo;s formula that use trigonometry, we will use the formula for the area of a triangle
\begin{equation} A = \frac{1}{2}ab\sin C \end{equation}</description>

      <description>The constants \(e\) and \(\pi\) are everywhere in mathematics. Determining the greater of the two expressions \(e^\pi\) and \(\pi^e\) (without using a calculator, of course&amp;hellip;) is a fun puzzle that you can approach in many ways. I&amp;rsquo;d like to discuss my solutions.
Differentiation We shall perform the same operations on the two expressions.
\begin{equation} \begin{split} e^{\pi} &amp;amp;\odot \pi^e \\
e^{\frac{\pi}{e}} &amp;amp;\odot \pi^{\frac{e}{e}} \\
e^{\frac{1}{e}} &amp;amp;\odot \pi^{\frac{1}{\pi}} \end{split} \end{equation}
To show that \(e^\pi &amp;gt; \pi^e\), it suffices to show that \(e^{\frac{1}{e}} &amp;gt; \pi^{\frac{1}{\pi}}\).</description>
