      <description>Problem Statement Given the first \(k\) terms of a sequence, it is impossible to say what the next one will be, as there are infinitely many polynomial functions that interpolate (that is, go through) each of these \(k\) points.
As an example, consider the perfect cubes \(1,8,27,64,\ldots\), given by \(P(n) = n^3\). We try to find an interpolating polynomial, operating by the principle of &amp;ldquo;simpler is better.&amp;rdquo; If we were given just the first term, the simplest possibility is that the sequence is constant.</description>

      <title>Project Euler 123: Prime Square Remainders</title>

      <description>Problem Statement Let \(p_n\) be the \(n\)-th prime and let \(r \equiv (p_n-1)^n +(p_n + 1)^n \Mod p_n^2\). Find the least value of \(n\) for which \(r &amp;gt; N\).
My Algorithm Expanding with the binomial theorem gives
\begin{equation} (p_n-1)^n +(p_n + 1)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} p_n^k((-1)^{n-k}+1). \end{equation}
That is, we sum \(2\binom{n}{k} p_n^k\) over even \(n-k\). Taking this modulo \(p_n^2\) means that all terms \(p_n^k\) with \(k&amp;gt;1\) disappear. And so when \(n\) is even, the sum evaluates to \(2\).</description>

      <description>Problem Statement In the \(5\)-by-\(5\) matrix below, the minimal path from the top left to the bottom right, where only moves to the right and down are allowed, is indicated in bold.
  Figure 1: The minimal path sum is \(2427\).
  Find the minimal path sum in a square matrix with \(n\) rows.
My Algorithm Starting at the bottom-right entry and traversing the matrix going up and to the right will yield a path from the top left to the bottom right.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement A \(3\)-by-\(2\) rectangular grid contains eighteen rectangles.
Given \(N\), consider all rectangular grids such that the number of rectangles in the grid is nearest to \(N\). Out of all such rectangular grids, return the area of the grid with the largest area.
My Algorithm The first thing we need is a way to count the number of rectangles contained within an \(n\)-by-\(m\) grid. Choosing a subrectangle is equivalent to choosing two vertical and two horizontal lines to cut out a rectangle.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement The smallest number that can be written as the sum of a prime square, prime cube, and prime fourth power is 28. In fact, there are exactly four numbers below fifty that can be expressed in this way:
\begin{equation*} \begin{split} 28 &amp;amp;= 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^{4}, \\
33 &amp;amp;= 3^2 + 2^3+2^{4}, \\
49 &amp;amp;= 5^2+2^3+2^{4}, \\
47 &amp;amp;= 2^2+3^3+2^{4}. \end{split} \end{equation*}
How many numbers less than or equal to \(N\) can be expressed in this way?</description>

      <description>Problem Statement It is easily proved that there exists no equilateral triangle with integral side lengths and integral area. Define an almost equilateral triangle as an isoceles triangle in which the third side length differs from the others by one. Some almost equilateral triangles have an integral area. One example is \((5,5,6)\) which has an area of 12.
Find the sum of the perimeters of all almost equilateral triangles with integral side lengths and integral area whose perimeters are at most \(N\).</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Given \(N\) pairs \(a_i,b_i,c_{i},d_i\), calculate the last twelve digits of
\begin{equation*} \sum_{i=1}^N (a_ib_{i}^{c_i}+d_{i}). \end{equation*}
My Algorithm This is equivalent to finding the value of the sum modulo \(10^{12}\). Using Python, this calculation is simple. The hardest part is formatting the answer, which must have the appropriate number of leading zeroes. We do all this in \(O(N)\) time.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Given \(N\) pairs \((a_i,b_i)\), find the \(K\)-th smallest value of \(a_i^{b_{i}}\).
My Algorithm Because \(\log x\) is strictly increasing, if \(a^b &amp;lt; c^d\), then \(b\log a &amp;lt; d\log c\). Using this principle, we sort the list of \((a_i,b_i)\) by the value of \(b_i\log a_i\) and select the \(K\)-th smallest value.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement For how many values \(P \le N\) is there exactly one way to form a right triangle with integer side lengths and perimeter \(P\)?
My Algorithm See my solution to Project Euler 39, as the techniques I use there are exactly the ones I use for this problem. The only difference is that we count only &amp;ldquo;singular&amp;rdquo; values of \(P\), and we binary search on the index of the greatest value up to \(N\).</description>

How many ways can \(N\) be written as the sum of at least two positive integers? Report your answer modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

      <description>Problem Statement The fraction \(\frac{a}{b}\) is called a reduced proper fraction if \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers with \(a &amp;lt; b\) and \(\mathrm{gcd}(a,b) = 1\). If we list the reduced proper fractions for \(b \le 8\) in increasing order, we get
\begin{equation*} \frac18, \frac17, \frac16, \frac15, \frac14, \frac27, \frac13, \frac38, \frac25, \frac37, \frac12, \frac47, \frac35, \frac58, \frac23, \frac57, \frac34, \frac45, \frac56, \frac67, \frac78 \end{equation*}

It can be seen that \(\frac25\) is the fraction immediately to the left of \(\frac37\).</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Pentagonal numbers are given by the formula
\begin{equation*} P_n = \frac{n(3n-1)}{2}. \end{equation*}
The first ten pentagonal numbers are
\begin{equation} 1,5,12,22,35,51,70,92,117,145,\ldots \end{equation}
It can be seen that \(P_4 + P_7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P_8\). Also, \(P_7 - P_5 = 70 - 35 = 35 = P_5\) is also pentagonal. Generalizing for a given \(k\), find all \(P_n\), where \(n &amp;lt; N\), such that at least one of \(P_n \pm P_{n-k}\) is pentagonal.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement The first two consecutive numbers to have distinct prime factors are \(14 = 2\cdot7\) and \(15 = 3\cdot5\). The first three consecutive such numbers are
\begin{equation*} \begin{split} 644 &amp;amp;= 2^2 \cdot 7 \cdot 23,\\

646 &amp;amp;= 2 \cdot 17 \cdot 19 \end{split} \end{equation*}

      <description>Problem Statement The sum \(1^1 + 2^2 + \cdots + 10^{10} = 10405071317\). Find the last ten digits of
\begin{equation} \sum\limits_{n=1}^N n^n. \end{equation}
My Algorithm This problem is a simple bignum computation. Because we only need the last ten digits, it suffices to carry out all calculations modulo \(10^{10}\). In particular, we use modular exponentiation. This solution has time complexity \(O(N\log N)\).</description>

      <description>Problem Statement It can be seen that the number \(125874\) and its double, \(251748\), contain exactly the same digits, but in a different order. Given \(N\), find all the positive integers up \(x \le N\) such that \(2x,3x,\ldots,Kx\) contain the same digits.
My Algorithm To check whether two strings are permutations of each other, we can check if they are equal after sorting. To check whether an array contains only strings that are permutations of each other, we take the first element of the array and apply the above procedure to each other string in the array.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement How many, not necessarily distinct, values of \(\binom{n}{r}\), for \(n \le N\), are greater than \(K\)?
My Algorithm A brute-force search is too slow. And so we exploit the symmetry of Pascal&amp;rsquo;s triangle, which contains the binomial coefficients. Because \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}\), we need only check up to \(\frac{n}{2}\). Furthermore, if \(\binom{n}{k}\) is the first value greater than \(K\), then because the entries of Pascal&amp;rsquo;s triangle strictly increase until the central term, all the entries between \(k\) and \(n-k\), inclusive, will be greater than \(K\).</description>

      <description>Problem Statement If we take 47, reverse it, and add, we get \(47 + 74 = 121\), which is a palindrome. Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example,
\begin{equation*} \begin{split} 349 + 943 &amp;amp;= 1292, \\
1292 + 2921 &amp;amp;= 4213, \\
4213 + 3124 &amp;amp;= 7337. \end{split} \end{equation*}
That is, 349 takes 3 iterations to arrive at a palindrome. Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers, like 196, never produce a palindrome.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement It is possible to show that \(\sqrt{2}\) has the following infinite continued fraction expansion:
\begin{equation*} \sqrt{2} = 1 + \frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{2 + \frac{1}{2 + \cdots}}} \end{equation*}
By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get the convergents of \(\sqrt{2}\)
\begin{equation*} \begin{split} 1 + \frac{1}{2} &amp;amp;= \frac{3}{2} \\
1 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{1}{2}} &amp;amp;= \frac{7}{5} \\
1 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{1}{2}}} &amp;amp;= \frac{17}{12} \\

  Figure 1: A 7-by-7 number spiral.
  It is interesting to note that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of \(\frac{8}{13} \approx 62\%\). If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement The five-digit number \(16807 = 7^5\) is also a fifth power. Given \(N\), find the $N$-digit positive integers that are also an $N$-th power.
My Algorithm An $n$-digit $n$-th power has $n$-th root at most 9, because \(10^n\) is an $(n+1)$-digit number. If \(a^n\) is an $n$-digit number, then unless \(a = 9\), we also have that \((a+1)^n\) is an $n$-digit number. We must find the lowest \(a\) such that \(a^n\) has \(n\) digits.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement The constant \(e\) can be written as the infinite continued fraction \([2;1,2,1,\,1,4,1,\,1,6,1,\ldots,1,2k,\ldots]\). Find the sum of the digits in the $N$-th convergent of the continued fraction expansion for \(e\).
A Recurrence Relation We will show the following theorem. Let the the $n$-th convergent of a continued fraction \([a_0;a_1,a_2,\ldots]\) be \(\frac{P_n}{Q_n}\). Then the $(n+1)$-th convergent is
\begin{equation} \frac{a_{n+1}P_n + P_{n-1}}{a_{n+1}Q_{n} + Q_{n-1}}. \end{equation}
We use induction. Because the 0-th convergent is \(a_0\), we define \(P_0 = a_0, Q_0 = 1\).</description>

  Given \(N\), find the smallest value \(n&amp;lt;N\) such that \(\frac{n}{\varphi(n)}\) achieves a maximum.

      <description>Problem Statement In England, the currency is made up of pounds (£) and pence (p), and there are eight coins in general circulation: 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p), and £2 (200p). It is possible to make £2 in the following way:
\begin{equation*} 1\cdot\mathrm{£}1 + 1\cdot50\mathrm{p} + 2 \cdot 20\mathrm{p} + 1 \cdot 5\mathrm{p} + 1 \cdot 2\mathrm{p} + 3\cdot1\mathrm{p} \end{equation*}
In how many ways can \(N\) pence be made from any denomination of coins?</description>

      <description>Problem Statement We shall say that an $N$-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to \(N\) exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number 15234 is 1 through 5 pandigital. The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity \(39 \cdot 186 = 7254\) containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital. Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through \(N\) pandigital.</description>

However, when \(n = 40\), we have \(40^2 + 40 + 41 = 41(40+1) + 41\), which is divisiblye by 41, and certainly when \(n = 41\), the expression \(41^2 + 41 + 41\) is clearly divisible by 41.</description>

If \(d(a) = b\) and \(d(b) = a\), where \(a \neq b\), then \(a\) and \(b\) are an amicable pair and each of \(a\) and \(b\) are amicable numbers. For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore \(d(220) = 284\).</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Find the first ten digits of the sum of \(N\) 50-digit numbers.
My Algorithm Thanks to Python&amp;rsquo;s built-in ability to handle infinitely large integers, this problem is a piece of cake. We read in the numbers, add them, convert the result to a string, and output the first ten characters.
Other Solutions In languages without big integer support, we would need an algorithm to add big integers, using string arrays and the carrying method often taught in elementary schools.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:
\begin{equation*} \begin{cases} n \to \frac{n}{2} \quad n \,\text{even}, \\
n \to 3n + 1 \quad n\,\text{odd} \end{cases} \end{equation*}
Using the rule above and starting with 13 generates the following sequence:
\begin{equation*} 13 \to 40 \to 20 \to 10 \to 5 \to 16 \to 8 \to 4 \to 2 \to 1 \end{equation*}
This sequence contains 10 terms.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
\begin{equation*} 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89,\ldots \end{equation*}
Find the sum of the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence not exceeding \(N\).
My Algorithm For the Project Euler problem, \(N = 4\times10^6\). Let&amp;rsquo;s list the Fibonacci numbers with \(F(0) = 0\):</description>

      <description>Problem Statement The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29. What is the largest prime factor of a given number \(N\)?
My Algorithm Splitting \(n\) into two factors gives one at least \(\sqrt{n}\) and one at most \(\sqrt{n}\). To see this, suppose not; if both were strictly less than \(\sqrt{n}\), then their product would be strictly less than \(n\), and if both were strictly greater, so would their product.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The smallest 6 digit palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers is \(101101 = 143 \cdot 707\). Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers which is less than \(N\).
My Algorithm We compute all products \(ij\) of numbers \(100 \le i,j \le 999\) and keep the palindromic ones. Then we sort the palindromic products and perform a binary search for the greatest element of the array strictly less than \(N\).</description>

      <description>Problem Statement 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to \(N\)?
My Algorithm For a number \(a\) to divide another number \(b\), each of the prime powers that divide \(a\) must also divide \(b\). That is, the exponent on each of the prime powers that divide \(a\) is less than or equal to the corresponding exponent on a prime power that divides \(b\).</description>

      <description>Problem Statement The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is
\begin{equation*} 1^2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 10^2 = 385. \end{equation*}
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is
\begin{equation*} (1 + 2 + \cdots + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025 \end{equation*}
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is \(3025 - 385 = 2640\).</description>

      <description>Problem Statement By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13. What is the $N$-th prime number?
My Algorithm We use the following identity, which is a consequence of the Prime Number Theorem:
\begin{equation} n(\log n + \log \log n - 1) &amp;lt; p_n &amp;lt; n(\log n + \log \log n), n &amp;gt; 5. \end{equation}</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Find the greatest product of \(K\) consecutive digits in the given \(N\) digit number.
My Algorithm We use a brute force solution. There are \(N-K+1\) possible $K$-length substrings of a string of length \(N\). We convert the given number to a string, find the substrings, and multiply the digits in them. We then find the maximal product. This is easily done with time complexity \(O(K(N-K+1))\).</description>

      <description>Problem Statement A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, \(a &amp;lt; b &amp;lt; c\), for which,
\begin{equation*} a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \end{equation*}
For example, \(3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52\). Given \(N\), find the maximal product \(abc\) such that \(a,b,c\) form a Pythagorean triplet for which \(a+b+c = N\). If no such triplet exists, output \(-1\).

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below \(n\).
My Algorithm The sum of the natural numbers up to \(n\) is the \(n\)-th triangular number. Let&amp;rsquo;s call this \(T(n)\). A well known formula for this is</description>

      <description>Welcome to the homepage of my Project Euler solutions. Once I solve the original problem, I also take on the modified version from ProjectEuler+ on HackerRank, where the problems usually have multiple, harder test cases. The time limits are much stricter, and brute force is rarely an option.
Why do I publish my solutions? After you solve a problem, Project Euler shows the following text:
We hope that you enjoyed solving this problem.</description>
