# Problem Statement

By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximal total from top to bottom is 23.

![Note that $3+7+4+9 = 23$.](../../figures/euler-18-triangle.png){ width=10% }

Find the maximum path length for a given such triangle with 100 rows.

# My Algorithm

Please see [Problem 18](../18/), which has an identical solution.
