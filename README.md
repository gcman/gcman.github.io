# Gautam Manohar's Personal Website

This repository houses the code behind my [personal website](https://gautammanohar.com).
The `master` branch contains the output HTML and CSS, as seen on the website.
The `src` branch contains all the behind-the-scenes code: raw Markdown files, any Python or LaTeX used to generate figures, and so on.
Only the `src` branch contains version history.
I built the blog using the static site generator [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/), which is written in Python.
