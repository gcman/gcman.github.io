** Voraciously curious. Ceaselessly skeptical. Unabashedly nerdy.
I'm Gautam. Welcome to my little corner of the web. You can take a look inside
my curious, skeptical, and nerdy brain on my [[/blog/][blog]].

I firmly believe in the power of ideas. Interesting ideas come from
all walks of life: academic subjects, learning a new language, meeting new
people, or idle musings over a good cup of tea. Such ideas give my life colour
and promise to occupy me for a lifetime.
** A good problem is never solved.
The most fulfilling problems lead not just to answers that satisfy inquiry but
to questions that further it. After all, what is an interesting idea without a
question to inspire it? Questions are the ultimate companion (non-human, of
course) to a lifelong learner. They motivate me to rejoice in spite of failure
and work hard in light of success. The path paved by interesting questions never
ends---and that's what makes it so exciting!
** Here's some more about me.
I'm a Grade 12 student at the [[https://utschools.ca][University of Toronto Schools (UTS)]]. My favourite
number is 7, but perhaps it should be \(n\): why pick one when you can consider
them all? My favourite (and unfortunately finite) anime series is Steins;Gate,
which is about time travel; my favourite infinite series is Fourier. It seems I
like time (and semicolons). Speaking of time, when I have some lying around, I
like to practice my handwriting and calligraphy, play table tennis, and watch
basketball.

:END:
**** Introduction
In this post, we will investigate the infinite series
\begin{equation}
\sum_{p} \frac{1}{p},
\end{equation}
taken over all primes $p$. In particular, we will show that this series
diverges.
**** Calculus and the Prime Number Theorem
First, we'll show that this problem falls to the incredible might of the
following inequalty, which bounds the value of the $n$-th prime:
\begin{equation}
n\log n - n \log\log n \le p_n \le n\log n + n\log\log n \quad (n > 5)
\end{equation}
This identity comes in quite handy when, say, you're solving some [[../euler/][Project Euler
problems]] about primes, and you need to generate at least $n$ primes. It's
derived from the Prime Number Theorem. Using the upper bound, we know that
$\frac{1}{p} \ge \frac{1}{n\log n + n \log\log n}$ for $n > 5$. And so
\begin{equation}
\sum_{p} \frac{1}{p} \ge \sum\limits_{n=6}^\infty \frac{1}{n\log n + n \log\log n}.
\end{equation}
Because $\log x$ is a monotonically increasing function, $\log\log x \le \log x$
for all $x$. And so $n\log n + n \log n \ge n\log n + n\log\log n$. This means
that
\begin{equation}
\sum\limits_{n=6}^\infty \frac{1}{n\log n + n \log\log n} \ge \sum\limits_{n=6}^\infty \frac{1}{2n\log n}.
\end{equation}
Here's where the calculus comes in. The integral test says that if a function
$f$ is non-negative, continuous, and monotonically decreasing on a certain
interval $[a,b+1]$, then the sum of $f(n)$ over integers $a \le n \le b$ is
greater than the integral of $f$ over that interval:
\begin{equation}
\int_a^{b+1} f(x) \d x < \sum\limits_{\substack{n \in \mathbb{Z}\\ a\le n \le b}}f(n)
\end{equation}
We know $x$ is increasing and continuous, as is $\log x$. And so $x \log x$ is
increasing and continuous, which means that $\frac{1}{x \log x}$ is decreasing.
On $[6,\infty)$, it's also non-negative. This means that
\begin{equation}
\sum_{p} \frac{1}{p} \ge \sum\limits_{n=6}^\infty \frac{1}{2n\log n} \ge \frac{1}{2} \int_6^\infty \frac{1}{x\log x} \d x.
\end{equation}
Substituting $u = \log x, \d u = \frac{1}{x} \d x$ gives
\begin{equation}
\int_{\log 6}^\infty \frac{\d u}{u},
\end{equation}
which we evaluate as $\left[ \log u \right]_{\log 6}^\infty = \infty$. But wait!
This means that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes is greater than
infinity, which of course means that it cannot converge to any finite value.
**** Combinatorics
In my opinion, this combinatorially inspired method is way cooler.
***** Squares and Squarefree Products
First, every integer can be written uniquely as the product of a square and a
squarefree integer (that is, a number which is not divisible by any square
greater than 1---such numbers are the products of distinct primes). To see this,
consider the prime factorization of a number
\begin{equation}
n = \prod_{p_i|n} p_i^{e_i},
\end{equation}
where $e_i$ is the greatest positive integer such that $p_i^{e_i}$ divides $n$.
Then for each odd $e_i$, factor out $p_i$. Then each exponent in the product is
even, which means it is a square, and the term outside the product consists of
primes with exponent 1.
***** Unleashing the Combo Punches
Second, each term in
\begin{equation}
\prod_p \left(1 + \frac{1}{p}\right)
\label{squarefree}
\end{equation}
is formed by multiplying either $1$ or $\frac{1}{p}$ for each $p$, which means
each term is the product of distinct primes. Furthermore, because the product is
over all primes, every possible combination of primes is represented here
exactly once. It is clear that
\begin{equation}
\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}
\label{square}
\end{equation}
contains the reciprocal of each square exactly once. Its value is the subject of
the Basel problem, which Euler famously solved: $\frac{\pi^2}{6}$. All we really
need is that the series converges to some finite value $C$. The product of
\eqref{squarefree} and \eqref{square} is
\begin{equation}
\left(\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}\right)\prod_p \left(1 + \frac{1}{p}\right) = \sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n},
\label{harm-prod}
\end{equation}
the harmonic series. This is because each term consists of a selection from the
first sum (of reciprocals of squares) and the second sum (of reciprocals of
squarefree numbers). Because all squares and squarefree numbers are here, the
reciprocal of each number is represented. This fact is not integral to the
divergence proof, but because the representation of a number as a product of a
square and a squarefree number is unique, each reciprocal is represented exactly
once, so the product is exactly equal to the harmonic series. The important fact
here is that the harmonic series diverges.
***** The Divergence of the Harmonic Series
To see this, we can use the integral test again (with the function
$\frac{1}{x}$), but we can also do it without calculus. Suppose the harmonic
series converges to some value $H$. Then
\begin{equation}
H = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \cdots
\end{equation}
Because $n + 1 > n$ for all $n$, we have $\frac{1}{n + 1} < \frac{1}{n}$ for all
$n$. Replacing terms in a sum with smaller terms means the resulting sum is
smaller. So
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
H &> \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + 1{4} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} + \cdots \\
&= 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \cdots \\
&= H.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We end up with $H > H$, which is certainly not true for any finite value. And so
the harmonic series diverges.
***** Finishing Touches
Third, we'll use the identity
\begin{equation}
1 + x \le e^x.
\label{e-ident}
\end{equation}
For three different proofs of this fact, see my post on [[../e-pi/][comparing $e^\pi$ and
$\pi^e$]]. Applying \eqref{e-ident} to \eqref{harm-prod} gives
\begin{equation}
\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty \le \left(\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}\right)\prod_p \left(1 + \frac{1}{p}\right) \le C\prod_p e^{-p}.
\end{equation}
Let's use some exponent rules to clean things up.
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty &\le Ce^{\sum_p \frac{1}{p}} \\
\log \sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty &\le \log C + \sum_p \frac{1}{p}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Becuase $C$ is finite, $\log C$ is also finite, and so we can see that the
desired sum is greater than the harmonic series, which establishes its
divergence.
**** Bounding the Beast
By slightly modifying the above arguments---for example, change infinite sums
over all primes or natural numbers to partial sums over all terms less than
$k$---we obtain the following bound:
\begin{equation}
\log\sum\limits_{n=1}^k \frac{1}{n} - \log \frac{\pi^2}{6} \le \sum\limits_{p \le k} \frac{1}{p}.
\end{equation}
We can make this even prettier by... using some calculus. Because $\frac{1}{x}$
is decreasing and continuous, we can use the integral test to bound the partial
harmonic series
\begin{equation}
\log\sum\limits_{n=1}^k \frac{1}{n} \ge \int_1^{k+1} \frac{1}{x} \d x = \log(k+1) - \log 1 = \log(k+1).
\end{equation}
And so we obtain the very nice lower bound
\begin{equation}
\log\log(k+1) - \log\frac{\pi^2}{6} \le \sum\limits_{p \le k} \frac{1}{p}.
\end{equation}
**** Conclusion
So, calculus or combinatorics? I think both methods are cool in their own
right---one uses continuous methods to analyze prime numbers, which are discrete
entities, while the other is just mind-numbingly brilliant. Perhaps the calculus
arguments are cleaner, but the combinatorics ones are much more inspiring and
hide some deeper insights.
*** Relatively Prime, Relatively Often               :primes:combinatorics:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: coprime-prob
:EXPORT_DATE: 2018-04-17
:EXPORT_DESCRIPTION: We derive the probability that two random integers are coprime.
:END:
Say you choose two integers. What's the chance that they're coprime? My
intuition says that it can't be more than one-half, because half of all numbers
share a factor of 2. But I'm thoroughly wrong here. The probability is actually
$\frac{6}{\pi^2}$, which is about $61\%$.

We wish to find the probability that two randomly selected integers $m$ and $n$
are coprime. If this is true, then $\mathrm{gcd}(m,n) = 1$. Let's say that $p =
\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{gcd}(m,n)=1)$. Consider $p_k =
\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{gcd}(a,b)=k)$ for some positive integer $k$. For this to happen, $k$ must divide both $a$ and $b$, and $\frac{a}{k}$ and $\frac{b}{k}$ must
be coprime.

And so $p_k =
\mathrm{P}(k|a\,\text{and}\,k|b)\cdot\mathrm{P}\left(\mathrm{gcd}\left(\frac{a}{k},\frac{b}{k}\right)
= 1\right)$. One in every $k$ integers is divisible by $k$, so the first
probability is $\frac{1}{k^2}$. The second probability is just $p$---because $a$ and $b$ were
random, so are $\frac{a}{k}$ and $\frac{b}{k}$. And so $p_k = \frac{p}{k^2}$.

But any two numbers have a greatest common divisor. That means the sum of $p_k$
over all $k$ covers all the possibilities, so it must be 1. That is,
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{p}{k^2} &= 1 \\
p &= \left(\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2}\right)^{-1}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
That sum is famously equal to $\frac{\pi^2}{6}$, as shown by Euler. And
so we conclude that $p = \frac{6}{\pi^2}$.

:EXPORT_DESCRIPTION: Some patterns in mathematics go on forever. But many "patterns" do anything but, instead ending spectacularly. Explore patterns that are "almost there."
:END:
Mathematics students are often told not to carelessly extrapolate small sample
sizes into general claims. Indeed, this is a general truth of life: isolated
examples do not constitute general proof. Say you wanted to convince me of a
fact about numbers. You could show me that your fact was true for all numbers up
to ten, a hundred, a million, or to whatever ridiculously huge number you could
think of---but it wouldn't constitute a mathematical proof.

This post will hopefully be the first in a series called "Almost There." I will
share interesting patterns that, although they seem to /surely/ continue, break
down eventually. You may have noticed that I spelled "sink" incorrectly in the
title. Sharp eye. That's because we're investigating some interesting properties
the $\mathrm{sinc}$ function:
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{sinc}\, x =
\begin{cases}
\frac{\sin x}{x} & \text{if}\ x \neq 0 \\
1 & \text{if}\ x = 0
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
It looks like this:
#+attr_html: :width 400px
[[/img/math/sinc.png]]

This function famously has no elementary antiderivative, yet its definite
integral over the real line evaluates to
\begin{equation}
\int_{-\infty}^\infty \mathrm{sinc}\, x \d x = \pi.
\end{equation}
Stay tuned for a proof of this fact. A great tool for playing around with
computations in math (and, thanks to the wonders of technology, a lot more) is
[[https://www.wolframalpha.com/][Wolfram Alpha]]. We can compute some pretty complicated integrals with it, like
\begin{equation}
\int_{-\infty}^\infty \mathrm{sinc}\, x\,\mathrm{sinc}\, \frac{x}{3} \d x = \pi,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\int_{-\infty}^\infty \mathrm{sinc}\, x\,\mathrm{sinc}\, \frac{x}{3}\,\mathrm{sinc}\, \frac{x}{5} \d x = \pi.
\end{equation}
Even as we multiply the integrand by another $\mathrm{sinc}$ function, the value
of the definite integral remains constant at $\pi$. The pattern continues for
quite a while. In fact,
\begin{equation}
\int_{-\infty}^\infty \mathrm{sinc}\, x\, \mathrm{sinc}\, \frac{x}{3}\, \mathrm{sinc}\, \frac{x}{5}\,\cdots\,\mathrm{sinc}\, \frac{x}{13} \d x = \pi.
\end{equation}
But with one more term, the pattern fails spectacularly:
\begin{equation}
\int_{-\infty}^\infty \mathrm{sinc}\, x\, \mathrm{sinc}\, \frac{x}{3}\, \mathrm{sinc}\, \frac{x}{5}\,\cdots\,\mathrm{sinc}\, \frac{x}{15} \d x
\end{equation}
takes on a value of
\begin{equation}
\frac{467807924713440738696537864469}{467807924720320453655260875000}\pi = \pi - 4.62 \times 10^{11}.
\end{equation}
What happened? After some research, I found that such integrals were documented
in [[https://carma.newcastle.edu.au/jon/sinc-sums.pdf][this paper]]. It turns out that, in general, for real numbers $a_1,\ldots,a_n$,
\begin{equation}
\int_{-\infty}^\infty \prod_{k=1}^n \mathrm{sinc}\, a_kx \d x
\end{equation}
evaluates to $\pi$ if $\sum_k a_k \le 2$. In particular, $1 + \frac{1}{3} +
\cdots + \frac{1}{13} = 2 - \frac{2021}{45045}$, but
adding $\frac{1}{15}$ pushes it over the edge. So we can construct sequences of
numbers $a_k$ such that the pattern holds for arbitrarily many terms before
failing, when the partial sum of the numbers $a_k$ crosses $2$.

Similarly, we can make sure the pattern always holds. For example, the series
$1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \cdots$ famously converges to $2$, so if we set
$a_k$ to be the reciprocal powers of two, the corresponding integral will be
equal to $\pi$... forever. But not all patterns hold forever---certainly not
this one!
*** Inspheres and Circumspheres of Simplices             :algebra:geometry:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: simplex-sphere
:EXPORT_DATE: 2018-02-17
:EXPORT_DESCRIPTION: Every triangle has an inscribed and circumscribed circle. We extend this to tetrahedra and their higher dimensional analogues, simplices.
:END:
Every triangle can be circumscribed by a circle, because a circle can always be
drawn through three given points, so long as they are not colinear. In fact,
every triangle also has a circle that is inscribed in it. These two circles are
called the triangle's circumcircle and incircle. Finding these circles for a
triangle is simple if the triangle is equilateral, a bit harder if it is
right-angled, and a bit harder still if it is not. What is less well-known is
that every tetrahedron also has a circumsphere and insphere. Given four points,
such that no three of them are colinear and not all four of them are coplanar,
there is a unique sphere that goes through all of them. Finding these spheres
for a regular tetrahedron is rather straightforward. In particular, a regular
tetrahedron's circumsphere is always three times larger in radius than its
insphere. But the analagous problem for an arbitrary, not necessarily regular,
tetrahedron is much hairier. I will present a geometric proof for the case of
the regular tetrahedron, and then a look into the circumsphere and insphere of
arbitrary tetrahedra using techniques from linear algebra. Finally, I will
generalize my work to arbitrary simplices (the higher-dimensional analogue of
tetrahedra) in arbitrary dimensions.
**** Regular Tetrahedra
We wish to find the ratio between the circumsphere and insphere of a regular
tetrahedron. Let $ABCD$ be a regular tetrahedron. Let $O$ be the centroid of
$ABCD$. Then because $ABCD$ is regular, $O$ is the incenter and circumcenter of
$ABCD$. Let $X$ be the centroid of the face opposite $A$. The volume of $OBCD$
is a quarter that of $ABCD$, because $ABCD$ is the union of
$OABC,OABD,OACD,OBCD$, and each of those tetrahedra with vertex $O$ is congruent
to the others. The volume of a tetrahedron is $\frac{1}{3}bh$. Since $ABCD$ and
$OBCD$ have the same base, triangle $BCD$, the height $OX$ is one quarter the
height $AX$. But because $AO = AX - OX$, and $\frac{1}{4}|AX| = |OX|$, then
$|AO| = \frac{3}{4}|AX|$. Note that $AO$ is the circumradius and $OX$ is the
inradius. Thus the ratio of the circumradius to the inradius in a regular
tetrahedron is $\frac{|AO|}{|OX|} = 3$.
**** Irregular Tetrahedra
We use coordinate geometry and linear algebra to find the inradius and
circumradius (and incenter and circumcenter) of a tetrahedron given the
coordinates of its vertices. To avoid immense computational tedium, we use
programming to numerically solve for the desired ratio.
***** Insphere
Let's first deal with the insphere. Let $(a,b,c)$ be the vector that gives the
coordinates of the incenter, and let $r$ be the inradius. Let the four vertices
of the tetrahedron be given by $\vec{V}_i = (x_i,y_i,z_i)$, where $i
\inn{1,2,3,4}$. Let $F_1$ be the face with vertices $\vec{V}_1, \vec{V}_2,
\vec{V}_3$. Let $F_2$ be formed by $\vec{V}_1,\vec{V}_2,\vec{V}_4$, $F_3$ by
$\vec{V}_1,\vec{V}_3,\vec{V}_4$, and $F_4$ by $\vec{V}_2,\vec{V}_3,\vec{V}_4$.
Let $\vec{n}_i$ represent the unit vector pointing out of the tetrahedron and
perpendicular to the face $F_i$ of the tetrahedron: that is, the unit
outward-facing normal vector to $F_i$. The defining characteristic of the
insphere is that each line from the incenter to the point of tangency on a given
face is perpendicular to that face and of equal length to the other such lines.
Taking a circular cross-section of the insphere such that the sphere and the
circle have the same center and point of tangency to the face, we see that the
tangent line to the circle must be at a right angle to the line joining the
point of tangency and the center (from a famous theorem about circles). Then we
have the condition that $(a,b,c) + r\vec{n}_i$ lies on $F_i$. Let us deal with
$F_1$. A vector perpendicular to the plane containing two vectors is given by
their cross product. We can let these two vectors be two of the edges of $F_1$.
An edge on a face is the displacement between two vertices of a face. Then the
cross product
\begin{equation}
(\vec{V}_2 - \vec{V}_1) \times (\vec{V}_3 - \vec{V}_1)
\label{unscaled-normal}
\end{equation}
is perpendicular to $F_1$. But \eqref{unscaled-normal} need not point outward.
To remove this ambiguity, we scale \eqref{unscaled-normal} by a negative value
if it is pointing inward and by a positive value if it is pointing outward.
Consider the dot product of \eqref{unscaled-normal} and the displacement vector
$\vec{V}_4 - \vec{V}_1$, which points from the first vertex away from the
outward-facing normal and to the fourth vertex. Thus the angle between the
outward-facing normal and this displacement vector is between $\frac{\pi}{2}$
and $\pi$, so the cosine of the angle is negative, so the dot product of these
two vectors is negative. Then scaling \eqref{unscaled-normal} by the negative of
the dot product yields an outward-facing normal. We then need to normalize this
vector to obtain the desired unit outward-facing normal vector $\vec{n}_1$:
\begin{equation}
\vec{n}_1 = -\frac{(\vec{V}_2 - \vec{V}_1) \times (\vec{V}_3 - \vec{V}_1)(\vec{V}_2 - \vec{V}_1) \times (\vec{V}_3 - \vec{V}_1)\cdot(\vec{V}_4 - \vec{V}_1)}{\norm{(\vec{V}_2 - \vec{V}_1) \times (\vec{V}_3 - \vec{V}_1)(\vec{V}_2 - \vec{V}_1) \times (\vec{V}_3 - \vec{V}_1)\cdot(\vec{V}_4 - \vec{V}_1)}}.
\label{normalized}
\end{equation}
The point-normal form for the equation of a plane perpendicular to a vector
$\vec{n}$ and which contains a point $P_0$ is, for some point $P$ on the plane,
\begin{equation}
(P - P_0) \cdot \vec{n} = 0.
\end{equation}
In particular, we want the equation for the plane which contains $F_1$. We use
$P = (a,b,c) + r\vec{n}_1$ (the point on $F_1$ tangent to the insphere) and $P_0
= \vec{V}_1$ (it can be any of the vertices of the face in question, in this
case $F_1$). This gives
\begin{equation}
((a,b,c) + r\vec{n}_1 - \vec{V}_1) \cdot \vec{n}_1 = 0.
\end{equation}
Distributing the dot product, we have
\begin{equation}
(a,b,c)\cdot\vec{n}_1 + r\vec{n}_1\cdot\vec{n}_1 - \vec{V}_1\cdot\vec{n}_1 = 0.
\end{equation}
We then break each vector into its three components:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
a\vec{n}_{1_x} + b\vec{n}_{1_y} + c\vec{n}_{1_z} + r(\vec{n}_{1_x}^2 + \vec{n}_{1_y}^2 + \vec{n}_{1_z}^2) & \\
\qquad - x_1\vec{n}_{1_x} - y_1\vec{n}_{1_y} - z_1\vec{n}_{1_z} &= 0 \\
a\vec{n}_{1_x} + b\vec{n}_{1_y} + c\vec{n}_{1_z} + r(\vec{n}_{1_x}^2 + \vec{n}_{1_y}^2 + \vec{n}_{1_z}^2) &= x_1\vec{n}_{1_x} + y_1\vec{n}_{1_y} + z_1\vec{n}_{1_z}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
This equation has four unknowns: the coordinates of the incenter $a,b,c$ and the
inradius $r$. Using the other three faces, we arrive at a system of four
equations with four unknowns:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
a\vec{n}_{1_x} + b\vec{n}_{1_y} + c\vec{n}_{1_y} + r(\vec{n}_{1_x}^2 + \vec{n}_{1_y}^2 + \vec{n}_{1_z}^2) &= x_1\vec{n}_{1_x} + y_1\vec{n}_{1_y} + z_1\vec{n}_{1_z} \\
a\vec{n}_{2_x} + b\vec{n}_{2_y} + c\vec{n}_{2_z} + r(\vec{n}_{2_x}^2 + \vec{n}_{2_y}^2 + \vec{n}_{2_z}^2) &= x_2\vec{n}_{2_x} + y_2\vec{n}_{2_y} + z_2\vec{n}_{2_z} \\
a\vec{n}_{3_x} + b\vec{n}_{3_y} + c\vec{n}_{3_z} + r(\vec{n}_{3_x}^2 + \vec{n}_{3_y}^2 + \vec{n}_{3_z}^2) &= x_3\vec{n}_{3_x} + y_3\vec{n}_{3_y} + z_3\vec{n}_{3_z} \\
a\vec{n}_{4_x} + b\vec{n}_{4_y} + c\vec{n}_{4_z} + r(\vec{n}_{4_x}^2 + \vec{n}_{4_y}^2 + \vec{n}_{4_z}^2) &= x_4\vec{n}_{4_x} + y_4\vec{n}_{4_y} + z_4\vec{n}_{4_z}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We can solve this system with matrices. Let
\begin{equation}
\vec{A} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\vec{n}_{1_x} & \vec{n}_{1_y} & \vec{n}_{1_y} & \vec{n}_{1_x}^2 + \vec{n}_{1_y}^2 + \vec{n}_{1_z}^2 \\
\vec{n}_{2_x} & \vec{n}_{2_y} & \vec{n}_{2_y} & \vec{n}_{2_x}^2 + \vec{n}_{2_y}^2 + \vec{n}_{2_z}^2 \\
\vec{n}_{3_x} & \vec{n}_{3_y} & \vec{n}_{3_y} & \vec{n}_{3_x}^2 + \vec{n}_{3_y}^2 + \vec{n}_{3_z}^2 \\
\vec{n}_{4_x} & \vec{n}_{4_y} & \vec{n}_{4_y} & \vec{n}_{4_x}^2 + \vec{n}_{4_y}^2 + \vec{n}_{4_z}^2
\end{bmatrix}
\label{insphere-A}
\end{equation}
Let
\begin{equation}
\vec{u} =
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1\vec{n}_{1_x} + y_1\vec{n}_{1_y} + z_1\vec{n}_{1_z} \\
x_2\vec{n}_{2_x} + y_2\vec{n}_{2_y} + z_2\vec{n}_{2_z} \\
x_3\vec{n}_{3_x} + y_3\vec{n}_{3_y} + z_3\vec{n}_{3_z} \\
x_4\vec{n}_{4_x} + y_4\vec{n}_{4_y} + z_4\vec{n}_{4_z}
\end{bmatrix}
\label{insphere-B}
\end{equation}
And let the solution vector be
\begin{equation}
\vec{v} =
\begin{bmatrix}
a \\
b \\
c \\
r
\end{bmatrix}
\label{insphere-sols}
\end{equation}
Then
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\vec{A}\vec{v} &= \vec{u} \\
\vec{v} &= \vec{A}^{-1}\vec{u}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
And so the inradius $r$ is the fourth element of $\vec{v}$, or $\vec{v}_4$.
***** Circumsphere
Now we deal with the circumsphere. Let the circumsphere have center $(A,B,C)$
and radius $R$. It then has the equation
\begin{equation}
(x - A)^2 + (y - B)^2 + (z - C)^2 = R^2
\label{sphere-eq}
\end{equation}
All four of a tetrahedron's vertices lie on its circumsphere, and so their
coordinates satisfy \eqref{sphere-eq}. We have four vertices with which we can
make a system of four equations:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
(x_1 - A)^2 + (y_1 - B)^2 + (z_1 - C)^2 &= R^2 \\
(x_2 - A)^2 + (y_2 - B)^2 + (z_2 - C)^2 &= R^2 \\
(x_3 - A)^2 + (y_3 - B)^2 + (z_3 - C)^2 &= R^2 \\
(x_4 - A)^2 + (y_4 - B)^2 + (z_4 - C)^2 &= R^2
\end{split}
\label{R-system}
\end{equation}
Subtracting the first equation from each of the other three, we have another
system of equations:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
2A(x_1-x_2) + 2B(y_1-y_2) + 2C(z_1-z_2) &= x_1^2 + y_1^2 + z_1^2 - x_2^2 - y_2^2 - z_2^2 \\
2A(x_1-x_3) + 2B(y_1-y_3) + 2C(z_1-z_3) &= x_1^2 + y_1^2 + z_1^2 - x_3^2 - y_3^2 - z_3^2 \\
2A(x_1-x_4) + 2B(y_1-y_4) + 2C(z_1-z_4) &= x_1^2 + y_1^2 + z_1^2 - x_4^2 - y_4^2 - z_4^2
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We can solve this system of equations using matrices. Let
\begin{equation}
\vec{M} =
2\begin{bmatrix}
x_1-x_2 & y_1-y_2 & z_1-z_2 \\
x_1-x_3 & y_1-y_3 & z_1-z_3 \\
x_1-x_4 & y_1-y_4 & z_1-z_4
\end{bmatrix}
\label{circumsphere-A}
\end{equation}
Let
\begin{equation}
\vec{u} =
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1^2 + y_1^2 + z_1^2 - x_2^2 - y_2^2 - z_2^2 \\
x_1^2 + y_1^2 + z_1^2 - x_3^2 - y_3^2 - z_3^2 \\
x_1^2 + y_1^2 + z_1^2 - x_4^2 - y_4^2 - z_4^2
\end{bmatrix}
\label{circumsphere-B}
\end{equation}
And let the solution vector be
\begin{equation}
\vec{v} =
\begin{bmatrix}
A \\
B \\
C
\end{bmatrix}
\label{circumsphere-sols}
\end{equation}
Then
\begin{equation}
\vec{v} = \vec{M}^{-1}\vec{u}.
\end{equation}
Having solved for $A,B,C$, we can solve for $R$ from one of the equations in
\eqref{R-system}. Let's use the first one.
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
R^2 &= (x_1 - A)^2 + (y_1 - B)^2 + (z_1 - C)^2 \\
R &= \sqrt{(x_1 - A)^2 + (y_1 - B)^2 + (z_1 - C)^2}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Although we could compute the components of $\vec{n}_i$ by doing long and
tedious calculations with cross products, dot products, and norms and invert our
matrices using, say, Gaussian elimination, the closed form expressions for the
inradius $r$ and the circumradius $R$ would be very unwieldy and so not very
useful.
**** Generalizing to n-Simplices
Our method generalizes readily to higher dimensions. The dot product generalizes
very simply. The one thing we need is a generalization of the cross product,
which is only defined in three dimensions... except we don't. Our only use for
the cross product was to find a vector normal to two others. The cross product
can be represented as the determinant of a matrix
\begin{equation}
\begin{vmatrix}
\vec{v}_1^1 & \vec{v}_1^2 & \vec{v}_1^3 \\
\vec{v}_2^1 & \vec{v}_2^2 & \vec{v}_2^3 \\
\vec{b}_1 & \vec{b}_2 & \vec{b}_3
\end{vmatrix}
\end{equation}
Here the subscript is the index of the vector (out of those we are taking the
cross product of) and the superscript is the index of the component in that
vector. Each vector $\vec{b}_i$ is the $i$-th basis vector of our
$n$-dimensional vector space. We can then write our generalized cross product of
$n-1$ vectors in $n$-dimensions as
\begin{equation}
\mathscr{C}(\vec{v}_1,\vec{v}_2,\ldots,\vec{v}_{n-1}) =
\begin{vmatrix}
\vec{v}_1^1 & \cdots & \vec{v}_1^{n} \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\vec{v}_{n-1}^1 & \cdots & \vec{v}_{n-1}^n \\
\vec{b}_1 & \cdots & \vec{b}_{n}
\end{vmatrix}
\end{equation}
But we can get even simpler. Determinants can get hard to compute as they get
large. And because we are only interested in the cross product for its
/direction/ (and not its magnitude; we normalize everything later anyway), we
can use a simpler method. Any element of the kernel of the $n-1$ by $n$ matrix
given by taking the $n-1$ vectors to be rows is in the orthogonal direction to
all the given vectors. An $n$ simplex is given by $n+1$ points, given by the
vectors $\vec{V}_i$, where $i$ is an integer from $1$ to $n+1$. Each of these
vectors has $n$ components, $\vec{V}_i^j$, where $j$ is an integer from $1$ to
$n$. Each of the $n+1$ faces is a collection of $n$ of the $n+1$ points. Again,
let's first deal with the insphere:
***** Insphere
Let the vector representing the insphere's coordinates have $n$ components
$c_i$. Imitating \eqref{normalized}, we have
\begin{equation} \label{general-insphere}
\vec{n}_1 = -\frac{\vec{C}(\vec{C}\cdot(\vec{V}_{n+1} - \vec{V}_1))}{\norm{\vec{C}(\vec{C}\cdot(\vec{V}_{n+1} - \vec{V}_1))}},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\vec{C} = \mathscr{C}((\vec{V}_2 - \vec{V}_1)\times(\vec{V}_3 - \vec{V}_1)\times \cdots \times (\vec{V}_{n} - \vec{V}_1)).
\end{equation}
Then we can use matrices again:
\begin{equation} \label{general-insphere-A}
\vec{A} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\vec{n}_i^j & \sum (\vec{n}_i^j)^2
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{general-insphere-B}
\vec{u} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\sum \vec{V}_i^j \vec{n}_i^j
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\vec{s} =
\begin{bmatrix}
c_1 \\
c_2 \\
\vdots \\
c_n \\
r
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
Then
\begin{equation}
\vec{A}\vec{s} = \vec{u}.
\end{equation}
***** Circumsphere
Let the vector representing the insphere's coordinates have $n$ components
$C_i$. Our procedure for finding the circumsphere generalizes readily as
follows.
\begin{equation}
\vec{M} = 2
\begin{bmatrix}
\vec{V}_1^1 - \vec{V}_2^1 & \cdots & \vec{V}_1^n - \vec{V}_2^n \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\vec{V}_1^1 - \vec{V}_{n+1}^1 & \cdots & \vec{V}_1^n - \vec{V}_{n+1}^n
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\vec{u} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\sum ((v_1^j)^2 - (v_2^j)^2) \\
\vdots \\
\sum ((v_1^j)^2 - (v_{n+1}^j)^2) \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\vec{s} =
\begin{bmatrix}
C_1 \\
C_2 \\
\vdots \\
C_n \\
r
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
Then
\begin{equation}
\vec{A}\vec{s} = \vec{u}.
\end{equation}
***** Implementing Our Higher Dimensional Processes
We'll use ~Python~ its ~numpy~ package. Let's first set up a function to
compute our generalized cross product using the kernel method. Here's a standard
implementation of finding the kernel, or nullspace, of a matrix, sourced from
[[http://scipy-cookbook.readthedocs.io/items/RankNullspace.html][here]].
#+BEGIN_SRC python -n
def nullspace(A, atol=1e-13, rtol=0):
    A = np.atleast_2d(A)
    u, s, vh = np.linalg.svd(A)
    tol = max(atol, rtol * s[0])
    nnz = (s >= tol).sum()
    ns = vh[nnz:].conj().T
    return np.array([k[0] for k in ns])
#+END_SRC
We return the element of the nullspace that is a vector of norm 1 and use it to calculate the generalized cross product.
#+BEGIN_SRC python +n
def gen_cross(v):
	n = len(v)
	m = np.array([[v[i][j] for j in range(n+1)] for i in range(n)])
	return nullspace(m)
#+END_SRC
The argument =v= will always be a list of lists; each element represents a vector.
Now we can calculate the incenter and inradius:
#+BEGIN_SRC python +n
def insphere(v):
	n = len(v) - 1
	faces = []
	normals = []
#+END_SRC
Note that =n= is the "dimension" of the tetrahedron.
#+BEGIN_SRC python +n
for i in range(n+1):
		faces.append(v + [v[n-i]])
		del faces[i][n-i]
	if n % 2 == 0:
		faces = list(reversed(faces))
	faces = np.array(faces)
#+END_SRC
Each face of an $n$-simplex consists of some $n$ of the given $n+1$ vertices.
Each element of =faces= has $n+1$ elements: the $n$ vertices of the face, and the
other vertex that is not part of the face. The statement involving the modulo
ensures that the orientation is correct in even dimensions. Then we can finish
it off by performing the calculations in \eqref{general-insphere} and setting up
the matrices as in \eqref{general-insphere-A} and \eqref{general-insphere-B}.
#+BEGIN_SRC python +n
	for f in faces:
		c = gen_cross([f[i] - f[0] for i in range(1,n)])
		unnormed = c * np.vdot(c, f[n] - f[0])
		normals.append((-1)**(n%2) * unnormed / np.linalg.norm(unnormed))
	A = np.array([[k[i] for i in range(n)] + [sum([k[i]**2 for i in range(n)])] for k in normals])
	B = np.array([sum([v[i][j]*normals[i][j] for j in range(n)]) for i in range(n+1)])
	return np.linalg.solve(A,B)
#+END_SRC
We go along a similar line for the circumsphere: we set up the matrices and solve.
#+BEGIN_SRC python +n
def circumsphere(v):
	n = len(v) - 1
	A = 2 * np.array([[v[0][j] - v[i][j] for j in range(n)] for i in range(1,n+1)])
	B = np.array([sum([v[0][j]**2 - v[i][j]**2 for j in range(n)]) for i in range(1,n+1)])
	sols = np.linalg.solve(A,B)
	R = sqrt(sum([(v[0][i] - sols[i])**2 for i in range(n)]))
	return np.append(sols, R)
#+END_SRC
And there you have it! It would be interesting to see how the ratio between
circumsphere and insphere (3 in 3 dimensions) changes as the dimension
increases. It will probably get much larger (because most of a high-dimensional
sphere's volume is near its surface and because the insphere's volume will
become very small), but how quickly?

:EXPORT_DESCRIPTION: We know about circles and spheres, and we know how to find their volumes. But what comes next? We find the volumes of hyperspheres in n dimensions. Along the way, we discover some identities related to the gamma function.
:END:
One of my favourite formulas in mathematics is the one for the area of a circle,
$\pi r^2$. Its simplicity intrigued my young mind; the circle is, in a sense,
the simplest, the /roundest/ shape, and this formula seems to encapsulate the
circle's aura of "completion." As I grew older, I learned more such formulas for
the volumes and surface areas of familiar geometric objects. In particular, I
learned of the formula for the volume of a sphere $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. Amused
as I was by these clever formulas, my curiosity began to take hold of me.
Questions filled my mind: isn't it interesting, that as the dimension of the
round shape went from 2 to 3, so did the exponent on the radius? Where did the
$\frac{4}{3}$ come from? Why do the formulas stop after circle and sphere? What
comes next? Does anything come next? These questions lay dormant in my mind for
a while, until my friend [[https://www.arifaulakh.com][Arif Aulakh]] challenged me to find an expression for the
volume of a sphere in an arbitrary number of dimensions. My curiosity rekindled,
I set out in search of the higher-dimensional sphere to answer the question:
what comes next?
**** Introduction
Before we embark on our journey, we need to lay out some basic definitions. A
sphere is the set of all points a given distance (let's call it $R$) from a
given center point. A ball is the space whose boundary is a sphere, or the set
of all points whose distance from a given center point is less than or equal to
$R$. For example, a sphere in $2$ dimensions is called a circle, and the
corresponding ball is called a disk. Upon hearing the word "circle," you might
imagine a flat coin-like object. That's not what a mathematician means when they
say circle. To a mathematician, a circle is just the boundary of that coin,
while a disk is the entirety of the points contained in (and on the boundary of)
the coin. Similarly, a sphere is the bounding surface of a ball. So let's call a
ball in $n$ Euclidean dimensions with a certain radius the $n$-ball of radius
$R$. Also, note that a $1$-ball is just a line segment. In $2$ dimensions, we
say closed figures have area, and in $3$ dimensions, we say they have volume.
The arbitrary-dimensional analogue of this concept is "content." For example,
the 2-ball has content $\pi R^2$, the 3-ball $\frac{4}{3}\pi R^2$. We shall find
a general formula for the content of an $n$-ball of radius $R$. Along the way,
we will uncover and explore some interesting related results.
**** A Recurrence Relation
Intutively, we can construct a $3$-ball out of a bunch of thin disks (think of
slicing a tomato). In the same way, we can construct a disk out of a bunch of
thin line segments. And remember, a disk is a $2$-ball, and a line segment is a
$1$-ball. There seems to be a certain modularity to the $n$-dimensional ball.
Let's formalize this idea on the scale of $2$ dimensions and then generalize to
an arbitrary number of dimensions. We wish to construct a $2$-ball from the
interval $[-R,R]$, centered on $0$. Let the distance from $0$ of a point on this
interval be $r$. Then construct a $1$-ball (line segment) of radius $\sqrt{R^2 -
r^2}$ centered on and perpendicular to the interval. Doing this for all points
on the interval yields a $2$-ball, constructed from the sum of infinitely many
$1$-balls. Similarly, we can construct a $3$-ball from infinitely many $2$-balls
centered on and perpendicular to the interval $[-R,R]$. Generalizing to $n$
dimensions yields the recurrence relation
\begin{equation}
V_{n}(R) = \int_{-R}^{R} V_{n-1}\left(\sqrt{R^2 - r^2}\right) \d r.
\label{first-recurrence}
\end{equation}
Uniformly scaling any object in $n$ dimensions by $R$ increases the content of
that object by a factor of $R^n$. This result can be shown with linear algebra.
We shall prove a weaker version of this statement for the $n$-ball.

*Lemma 1. (Proportionality)* Uniformly scaling a $n$-dimensional ball by $R$ increases the
content of the ball by $R^n$.

As a base case, proportionality clearly holds for
$n = 0$, where all balls have content $1$. Here scaling by a factor of $R$
scales content by a factor of $R^0 = 1$. Then assume inductively that
proportionality holds for an $(n-1)$-ball. Then we can factor $R^{n-1}$ from the
integrand in \eqref{first-recurrence}:
\begin{equation}
V_{n}(R) = R^{n-1}\int_{-R}^{R} V_{n-1}\left(\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{r}{R}\right)^2}\right) \d r.
\end{equation}
Substituting $x = \frac{r}{R}, \d x = \frac{\d x}{R}$ yields
\begin{equation}
V_n(R) = R^n\int_{-1}^1 V_{n-1}\left(\sqrt{1-x^2}\right) \d x = R^nV_n(1),
\label{induction-2}
\end{equation}
which proves that proportionality holds in $n$ dimensions and, by induction, in
all non-negative integer dimensions. $\qed$ Then proportionality transforms
\eqref{induction-2} into
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
V_{n}(R) &= R^nV_{n-1}(1)\int_{-1}^{1} \left(\sqrt{1-x^2}\right)^{n-1} \d x \\
&= V_{n-1}(R)R \int_{-1}^{1} \left(1-x^2\right)^\frac{n-1}{2} \d x.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Because the integrand is an even function in $x$,
\begin{equation}
V_{n}(R) = 2V_{n-1}(R)R \int_{0}^{1} \left(1-x^2\right)^\frac{n-1}{2} \d x.
\end{equation}
The expression of interest to us is the integral. For notational simplicity, we
define
\begin{equation}
I_{k} = 2\int_{0}^{1} \left(1-x^2\right)^\frac{k}{2} \d x.
\label{I-initial}
\end{equation}
Then
\begin{equation}
V_{n}(R) = I_{n-1}V_{n-1}(R)R.
\label{volume-recurrence}
\end{equation}
Let us now solve for $I_{n-1}$.
**** Solving the Integral
We shall prove the result
\begin{equation}
I_{n-1} = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}\Gamma\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)}{\Gamma(\frac{n}{2}+1)}
\label{I-final}
\end{equation}
in two ways: analytically and with a probabalistic argument.
***** An Analytical Argument
We substitute $x = \cos\theta, \d x = -\sin\theta\d\theta$ into
\eqref{I-initial}.
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
I_{n-1} &= -2\int_{\frac{\pi}{2}}^0 \left(1-\cos^2\theta\right)^\frac{n-1}{2} \sin\theta \d\theta \\
&= 2\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \left(\sqrt{\sin^2\theta}\right)^{n-1} \sin\theta \d\theta \\
&= 2\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \abs{\sin\theta}^{n-1} \sin\theta \d\theta.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Because $\sin\theta$ is non-negative over $[0,\frac{\pi}{2}]$, we have
\begin{equation}
I_{n-1} = 2\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \sin^n\theta \d\theta.
\end{equation}
We define the function
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{I}(n,m) = 2\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \sin^n\theta \cos^m\theta \d\theta.
\label{I-definition}
\end{equation}
Then $I_{n-1} = \mathcal{I}(n,0)$. We substitute $t = \tan^2\theta, \d t =
2\tan\theta\sec^2\theta \d\theta = 2\sin\theta\sec^3\theta\d\theta$ into
\eqref{I-definition}. This gives $\frac{1}{1+t} = \cos^2\theta$ and $1 -
\frac{1}{1+t} = \frac{t}{1+t} = \sin^2\theta$.
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mathcal{I}(n,m) &= 2\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} (\sin^2\theta)^\frac{n}{2} (\cos^2\theta)^\frac{m}{2} \d\theta \\
&= \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} (\sin^2\theta)^{\frac{n-1}{2}} (\cos^2\theta)^{\frac{m+3}{2}} 2\sin\theta\sec^3\theta \d\theta \\
&= \int_0^{\infty} \left(\frac{t}{1+t}\right)^{\frac{n-1}{2}} \left(\frac{1}{1+t}\right)^{\frac{m+3}{2}} \d t \\
&= \int_0^{\infty} \frac{t^{\frac{n-1}{2}}}{(1+t)^{\frac{n+m}{2}+1}} \d t.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
For simplicity, let $n = 2\alpha - 1, m = 2\beta - 1$. Then
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{I}(n,m) = \int_0^{\infty} \frac{t^{\frac{n-1}{2}}}{(1+t)^{\frac{n+m}{2}+1}} \d t = \int_0^{\infty} \frac{t^{\alpha-1}}{(1+t)^{\alpha + \beta}} \d t.
\label{alpha-beta}
\end{equation}
Let us now state two lemmas which we shall prove later.

*Lemma 2.* Given real numbers $\alpha, \beta$, we have
\begin{equation}
\int_0^{\infty} \frac{t^{\alpha-1}}{(1+t)^{\alpha + \beta}} \d t = \frac{\Gamma(\alpha)\Gamma(\beta)}{\Gamma(\alpha + \beta)}.
\label{claim}
\end{equation}

*Lemma 3.*
\begin{equation}
\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \sqrt{\pi}
\end{equation}

Applying Lemma 2 to \eqref{alpha-beta} gives
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{I}(n,m) = \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{m+1}{2}\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n+m}{2} + 1\right)}.
\label{I-gamma}
\end{equation}
Recall that $I_{n-1} = \mathcal{I}(n,0)$. Then applying Lemma 3 gives
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
I_{n-1} &= \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}{\Gamma(\frac{n}{2}+1)} \\
&= \frac{\sqrt{\pi}\Gamma\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)}{\Gamma(\frac{n}{2}+1)},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
which establishes \eqref{I-final}. $\qed$
***** A Statistical Argument
Let “choosing a number“ be done with a uniform probability. Let $\alpha$ and
$\beta$ be positive integers. The probability of choosing first choosing a real
$p$ in the interval $[0,1]$, then choosing $\alpha$ real numbers in $[0,p]$, and
then choosing $\beta$ real numbers in $[p,1]$ is $\int_0^1 p^\alpha(1-p)^\beta
\d p$. Then the probability of choosing $\alpha + \beta + 1$ real numbers in
$[0,1]$ such that the first number is $p$, some $\alpha$ of the remaining
numbers are in $[0,p]$, and some $\beta$ of them are in $[p,1]$ is
$\binom{\alpha + \beta}{\alpha}\int_0^1 p^\alpha(1-p)^\beta$. But this is the
same as the probability that, after $p$ and $\alpha + \beta$ real numbers in
$[0,1]$ are placed in increasing order, $p$ happens to be in the $(\alpha +
1)$-th position, or $\frac{1}{\alpha + \beta + 1}$. This yields
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\binom{\alpha + \beta}{\alpha} \int_0^1 p^\alpha(1-p)^\beta \d p &= \frac{1}{\alpha + \beta + 1} \\
\frac{(\alpha + \beta)!}{\alpha!\beta!}\int_0^1 p^\alpha(1-p)^\beta \d p &= \frac{1}{\alpha + \beta + 1} \\
\int_0^1 p^\alpha(1-p)^\beta \d p &= \frac{\alpha!\beta!}{(\alpha + \beta + 1)!}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Generalizing with the gamma function $\Gamma(n+1) = n!$, we have
\begin{equation}
\int_0^1 p^\alpha(1-p)^\beta \d p = \frac{\Gamma(\alpha + 1)\Gamma(\beta + 1)}{\Gamma(\alpha + \beta + 2)}.
\end{equation}
Substituting $p = x^2, \d p = 2x\d x$ yields
\begin{equation}
2\int_0^1 x^{2\alpha+1}(1-x^2)^\beta \d x = \frac{\Gamma(\alpha + 1)\Gamma(\beta + 1)}{\Gamma(\alpha + \beta + 2)}
\end{equation}
Setting $\alpha = -\frac{1}{2}, \beta = \frac{n-1}{2}$ yields the desired
\eqref{I-final}:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
2\int_0^1 (1-x^2)^\frac{n-1}{2} \d x &= \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\Gamma(\frac{n+1}{2})}{\Gamma(\frac{n}{2}+1)} \\
I_{n-1} &= \frac{\sqrt{\pi}\Gamma(\frac{n+1}{2})}{\Gamma(\frac{n}{2}+1)}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$\qed$
**** A General Formula
Now let's put it all together.

*Theorem 1.* The content of an $n$-ball of radius $R$, denoted $V_n(R)$, is given
by
\begin{equation}
V_n(R) = \frac{R^n\pi^\frac{n}{2}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}+1\right)}.
\label{general-volume}
\end{equation}

Expanding \eqref{volume-recurrence} using \eqref{I-final}, we have
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
V_n(R) &= I_{n-1}V_{n-1}(R)R \\
&= R\frac{\sqrt{\pi}\Gamma\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}+1\right)}V_{n-1}(R) \\
&= \left(R\frac{\sqrt{\pi}\Gamma\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}+1\right)}\right)\left(R\frac{\sqrt{\pi}\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n-1}{2}+1\right)}\right)\cdots\left(R\frac{\sqrt{\pi}\Gamma\left(\frac{n+2-m}{2}\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n-m}{2}+1\right)}\right)V_{n-m}(R) \\
&= R^m\pi^\frac{m}{2}\left(\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{n-1}{2}+1\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}+1\right)}\right)\left(\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{n-2}{2} + 1\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n-1}{2}+1\right)}\right)\cdots\left(\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{n-m}{2} + 1\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n-m+1}{2}+1\right)}\right)V_{n-m}(R).
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The $m$-th numerator is the same as the $(m+1)$-st denominator, so
\begin{equation}
V_n(R) = V_{n-m}(R)R^m\pi^{\frac{m}{2}}\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{n-m}{2} + 1\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}+1\right)}.
\end{equation}
Because a $0$-dimensional ball of any radius consists of only one point, $V_0(R)
= 1$. Setting $m = n$, we obtain our general expression for the content of an
$n$-dimensional ball and establish Theorem 1.
**** Proofs and Other Results
***** A Trigonometric Integral Identity
From \eqref{I-gamma}, it follows that $\mathcal{I}(n,m) = \mathcal{I}(m,n)$. So
$\frac{1}{2}\mathcal{I}(n,0) = \frac{1}{2}\mathcal{I}(0,n)$. Then \eqref{I-definition} implies the
interesting identity
\begin{equation}
\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \sin^n\theta \d\theta = \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \cos^n\theta \d\theta.
\end{equation}
***** Gamma Fraction Identity: Proof of Lemma 2
Lemma 2, which states that
\begin{equation}
\int_0^{\infty} \frac{t^{\alpha-1}}{(1+t)^{\alpha + \beta}} \d t = \frac{\Gamma(\alpha)\Gamma(\beta)}{\Gamma(\alpha + \beta)},
\end{equation}
was key in our analytical argument. We shall prove it here. The gamma function
is defined as
\begin{equation}
\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty e^{-t}t^{z-1} \d t.
\label{gamma}
\end{equation}
In \eqref{gamma} we make the substitution $t = pq$, $\d t = q\d p$.
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Gamma(\alpha) &= \int_0^\infty e^{-pq}(pq)^{\alpha-1} q\d p \\
&= \int_0^\infty q^\alpha e^{-pq}p^{\alpha-1} \d p.
\end{split}
\label{gamma-reworked}
\end{equation}
We multiply both sides of \eqref{gamma-reworked} by $\Gamma(\beta) =
\int_0^\infty e^{-q}q^{\beta-1} \d q$.
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Gamma(\alpha)\Gamma(\beta) &= \left(\int_0^\infty q^\alpha e^{-pq}p^{\alpha-1} \d p\right)\left(\int_0^\infty e^{-q}q^{\beta-1} \d q\right) \\
&= \int_0^\infty \int_0^\infty e^{-q-pq}q^{\alpha+\beta-1}p^{\alpha-1} \d p \d q \\
&= \int_0^\infty p^{\alpha-1} \d p \int_0^\infty e^{-q(1+p)}q^{\alpha+\beta-1} \d q.
\end{split}
\label{gamma-product}
\end{equation}
In the inner integral we substitute $q = \frac{s}{1+p}, \d q = \frac{\d s}{1 +
p}$. Then
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\int_0^\infty e^{-q(1+p)}q^{\alpha+\beta-1} \d q &= \int_0^\infty e^{-s}\left(\frac{s}{1+p}\right)^{\alpha+\beta-1} \frac{\d s}{1+p} \\
&= \frac{1}{(1+p)^{\alpha+\beta}}\int_0^\infty e^{-s}s^{\alpha+\beta-1} \d s \\
&= \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta)}{(1+p)^{\alpha+\beta}}.
\end{split}
\label{g-prod-reworked}
\end{equation}
Substituting \eqref{g-prod-reworked} into \eqref{gamma-product}, we have
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Gamma(\alpha)\Gamma(\beta) &= \int_0^\infty p^{\alpha-1} \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta)}{(1+p)^{\alpha+\beta}} \d p \\
\frac{\Gamma(\alpha)\Gamma(\beta)}{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta)} &= \int_0^\infty \frac{p^{\alpha-1}}{(1+p)^{\alpha+\beta}} \d p,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
which establishes the desired result. $\qed$
***** Gamma of One-Half: Proof of Lemma 3
We shall prove Lemma 3, that $\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \sqrt{\pi}$. In
\eqref{claim}, set $\alpha = \beta = \frac{1}{2}$. Then
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}{\Gamma(1)} &= \int_0^\infty \frac{t^{-\frac{1}{2}}}{1+t} \d t \\
\Gamma^2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) &= \int_0^\infty \frac{1}{\sqrt{t}(1+t)} \d t.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We substitute $t = x^2, \d t = 2x\d x = 2\sqrt{t}\d x$:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Gamma^2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) &= 2\int_0^\infty \frac{1}{1 + x^2} \d x \\
&= 2\left(\arctan x \big|_0^\infty \right) \\
&= 2\cdot\frac{\pi}{2} \\
&= \pi,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
so
\begin{equation}
\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \pm\sqrt{\pi}.
\end{equation}
But in the integral representation of $\Gamma(z)$, the integrand $e^{t}t^{z-1}$
is positive if $z > 0$. This yields the desired result,
\begin{equation}
\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \sqrt{\pi}
\end{equation}
A consequence of this result is the value of the famous Gaussian integral
\begin{equation}
\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2} \d x,
\end{equation}
whose integrand has no elementary antiderivative. Substituting $t = x^2, \d t =
2t^{\frac{1}{2}}\d x$ into the integral representation of
$\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$, we have
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\sqrt{\pi} &= \Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \\
&= \int_0^\infty e^{-t}t^{-\frac{1}{2}} \d t \\
&= 2\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} \d x.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Because the integrand $e^{-x^2}$ is an even function, it follows that
\begin{equation}
\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2} \d x = \sqrt{\pi}.
\end{equation}
***** Gamma Function Doubling Formula
We have the following result.

*Theorem 2. (Gamma Function Doubling Formula)*
\begin{equation}
\Gamma(2z) = \frac{2^{2z-1}\Gamma(z)\Gamma\left(z + \frac{1}{2}\right)}{\sqrt{\pi}}
\label{gamma-duplication}
\end{equation}

To prove this result, we shall use integration by parts and \eqref{I-final}. Let
\begin{equation}
A_k = \int_{0}^{1} \left(1-x^2\right)^k \d x.
\label{A-definition}
\end{equation}
Then, integrating by parts, we have
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
A_k &= x(1-x^2)^k \big|_0^1 - \int_0^1 -2xk(1-x^2)^{k-1}x \d x \\
&= 2k\int_0^1 x^2(1-x^2)^{k-1} \d x \\
&= 2k\int_0^1 (1-(1-x^2))(1-x^2)^{k-1} \d x \\
&= 2k\int_0^1 (1-x^2)^{k-1} - (1-x^2)^k \d x \\
&= 2kA_{k-1} - 2kA_k \\
&= \frac{2k}{2k+1}A_{k-1}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Expanding the recurrence relation yields
\begin{equation}
A_k = \frac{(2k)(2k-2)\cdots4\cdot2}{(2k+1)(2k-1)\cdots3\cdot1}.
\end{equation}
Let us first deal with the numerator. We know that
\begin{equation}
k! = k(k-1)\cdots2\cdot1.
\end{equation}
Multiplying each of the $k$ terms on the right-hand side by $2$ yields the
numerator. So the numerator is equal to $2^kk!$. Then we deal with the
denominator. We know that
\begin{equation}
(2k+1)! = (2k+1)(2k)\cdots2\cdot1.
\end{equation}
Dividing both sides of this equation by $2^kk!$ yields the denominator. So the
denominator is equal to $\frac{(2k+1)!}{2^kk!}$. Then
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
A_k &= \frac{2^kk!}{\frac{(2k+1)}{2^kk!}} \\
&= \frac{(2^kk!)^2}{(2k+1)!}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Generalising using the gamma function $\Gamma(n+1) = n!$ yields
\begin{equation}
A_k = \frac{2^{2k}\Gamma^2(k+1)}{\Gamma(2k+2)}.
\label{A-gamma}
\end{equation}
From \eqref{I-initial} and \eqref{A-definition}, $I_{n-1} = 2A_{\frac{n-1}{2}}$,
so by \eqref{A-gamma},
\begin{equation}
I_{n-1} = \frac{2^n\Gamma^2\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)}{\Gamma(n+1)}.
\label{I-by-parts}
\end{equation}
Equating \eqref{I-by-parts} with \eqref{I-final} and making the substitution $z
= \frac{n+1}{2}$ establishes Theorem 2.
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{2^{2z-1}\Gamma^2(z)}{\Gamma(2z)} &= \frac{\sqrt{\pi}\Gamma(z)}{\Gamma(z + \frac{1}{2})} \\
\Gamma(2z) &= \frac{2^{2z-1}\Gamma(z)\Gamma\left(z + \frac{1}{2}\right)}{\sqrt{\pi}}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$\qed$ This result is very powerful. It implies that, combined with the
recurrence relation $\Gamma(n+1) = n\Gamma(n)$, we can compute
$\Gamma(\frac{n}{2})$ for any positive integer $n$. Then we can also compute all
expressions of the form $\Gamma(\frac{n}{4})$, because the right-hand side of
\eqref{gamma-duplication} will be in terms of expressions of the form
$\Gamma(\frac{n}{2})$. Thus for any positive real number $r$ whose binary
expansion is finite---that is, for any positive rational $r$---we can thus
compute $\Gamma(r)$. And because every irrational number can be written as the
limit of the partial sums of a sequence of rational numbers, we can compute
$\Gamma(r)$ for any positive real $r$.
***** Approximating the Logarithmic Derivative of the Gamma Function
Consider the logarithmic derivative of the gamma function, which we shall call
$\mathcal{G}(x)$:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{G}(x) = \frac{\d}{\d x}\ln\Gamma(x) = \frac{\Gamma'(x)}{\Gamma(x)}.
\label{log-deriv-gamma}
\end{equation}
For the sake of this section, let $\mathcal{G} = \frac{\Gamma'(x)}{\Gamma(x)}$.
Then we shall prove

*Theorem 3.* The following upper and lower bounds hold for
the logarithmic derivative of the gamma function:
\begin{equation}
\ln x - \frac{1}{x} < \mathcal{G}(x) < \ln x.
\label{gamma-log-deriv-bounds}
\end{equation}

To do this, we first show the following lemma, which may seem intuitive.

*Lemma 4.* Let $f(x)$ be a differentiable function defined on $[a,b]$. Then if
$f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \in [a,b]$, then $f(x)$ is strictly increasing.

By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,
\begin{equation}
\int_a^b f'(x) \d x = f(b) - f(a).
\end{equation}
If $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x$, then because the integral of a positive integrand is
also positive, $f(b) > f(a)$ for all $x$. That is, $f(x)$ is strictly
increasing. $\qed$ We also use the following lemma for continuous functions,
which is a special case of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

*Lemma 5.* Let $f$ and $g$ be continuous functions defined over $[a,b]$. Then we
have
\begin{equation}
\left(\int_a^b fg \d t\right)^2 \le \left(\int_a^b f^2 \d t\right)\left(\int_a^b g^2 \d t\right).
\end{equation}
In particular, equality holds if and only if $f$ is proportional to $g$; that
is, there exists some $z$ such that for all $x \in [a,b]$, we have $zf(x) =
g(x)$.

Let's take some contant $z$. Then $0 \le (fz - g)^2$. And because the
integral of a non-negative function is also non-negative, for all real $z$, we
have
\begin{equation}
0 \le \int_a^b (fz - g)^2 \d t = \left(\int_a^b f^2 \d t \right)z^2 - \left(\int_a^b 2fg \d t\right)z + \left(\int_a^b g^2 \d t\right).
\end{equation}
Because this quadratic is non-negative, its discriminant must be non-positive,
such that
\begin{equation}
4\left(\int_a^b fg \d t\right)^2 \le 4\left(\int_a^b f^2 \d t\right)\left(\int_a^b g^2 \d t\right).
\label{discriminant}
\end{equation}
Equality only holds in \eqref{discriminant} if $\int_a^b (fz - g)^2 \d t = 0$.
Consider a function $h'$ continuous over $[a,b]$ such that $\int_a^b h'(x) \d x
= 0$. By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, this integral equals $h(b) -
h(a)$, so $h(a) = h(b)$; that is, $h$ is a constant function, so the integrand
$h'$ is the zero function. Thus equality only holds in \eqref{discriminant} if
$fz = g$. $\qed$

*Lemma 6.* For non-negative real $x$, $\mathcal{G}(x)$ is a strictly increasing
function.

We will prove Lemma 6 by showing that $\mathcal{G}'(x)$ is positive everywhere.
We have
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Gamma'(x) &= \frac{\d}{\d x}\int_0^\infty e^{-t}t^{x-1} \d t \\
&= \int_0^\infty \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\, e^{-t}t^{x-1} \d t \\
&= \int_0^\infty e^{-t}t^{x-1}\ln t \d t,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
and, similarly,
\begin{equation}
\Gamma''(x) = \int_0^\infty e^{-t}t^{x-1} \ln^2 t \d t.
\end{equation}
Furthermore,
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{G}'(x) = \frac{\Gamma(x)\Gamma''(x)-(\Gamma'(x))^2}{\Gamma^2(x)}.
\label{gamma-second-deriv}
\end{equation}
Substituting $\alpha = \sqrt{e^{-t}t^{x-1}}$ and $\beta = \ln
t\sqrt{e^{-t}t^{x-1}}$ into \eqref{gamma-second-deriv} yields
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{G}'(x) = \frac{\left(\int_0^\infty \alpha^2 \d t\right) \left(\int_0^\infty \beta^2 \d t\right) - \left(\int_0^\infty \alpha\beta \d t\right)^2}{\Gamma^2(x)}.
\label{integral-gamma-2-deriv}
\end{equation}
We note that functions $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are continuous and not proportional
(because $\ln t$ is not constant with respect to $t$) to one another over
$[0,\infty)$. Then Lemma 5 shows, with strict inequality, that
\begin{equation}
\left(\int_0^\infty \alpha\beta \d t\right)^2 < \left(\int_0^\infty \alpha^2 \d t\right) \left(\int_0^\infty \beta^2 \d t\right).
\label{fg-inequality}
\end{equation}
The denominator of \eqref{integral-gamma-2-deriv} is always positive, so
\eqref{fg-inequality} shows that \eqref{gamma-second-deriv} is positive for all
non-negative real $x$. Finally, Lemma 4 establishes that $\mathcal{G}(x)$ is a
strictly increasing function. $\qed$

*Lemma 7.* We have $\mathcal{G}(x + 1) = \mathcal{G}(x) + \frac{1}{x}$.

We have $\Gamma(x+1) = x\Gamma(x)$, so $\ln(\Gamma(x+1)) = \ln\Gamma(x) + \ln
x$. Differentiating establishes the result. $\qed$

*Lemma 8.* We have the following inequality: $\mathcal{G}(x) < \ln x <
\mathcal{G}(x + 1)$.

By the Mean Value
Theorem, there exists some $z$ in $(x, x+1)$ such that
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mathcal{G}(z) &= \frac{\ln\Gamma(x+1) - \ln\Gamma(x)}{x+1-x} \\
&= \ln(x\Gamma(x)) - \ln\Gamma(x) \\
&= \ln x.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
In particular, note that $x < z < x + 1$. By Lemma 6, $\mathcal{G}(x)$ is
strictly increasing. So $\mathcal{G}(x) < \mathcal{G}(z) = \ln x <
\mathcal{G}(x+1)$, and we establish Lemma 8. $\qed$

Finally, we can establish Theorem 3 by applying Lemma 7 and Lemma 8:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mathcal{G}(x) < \ln x < \mathcal{G}(x + 1) &= \mathcal{G}(x) + \frac{1}{x} \\
\ln x < \mathcal{G}(x + 1) &< \ln x + \frac{1}{x} \\
\ln x - \frac{1}{x} < \mathcal{G}(x) &< \ln x.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$\qed$
***** Surface Area of Hyperspheres
We can build a the $2$-ball, or disk, from the union of concentric $2$-sphere
(circle) shells all evenly spaced by a distance $\d r$. This is like the layers
of an onion. This generalizes to $n$ dimensions, where an $n$-ball is the union
of concentric $n$-sphere shells. As $\d r$ tends to $0$, we find that the
content of a $n$-ball is the sum of the surface areas of the infinitely many
$n$-spheres with radii ranging from $0$ to $R$. That is,
\begin{equation}
V_n(R) = \int_0^R S_n(r) \d r,
\end{equation}
which gives
\begin{equation}
S_n(R) = \frac{\d V_n(R)}{\d R}.
\end{equation}
Substituting \eqref{general-volume} yields
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
S_n(R) &= \frac{nR^{n-1}\pi^{\frac{n}{2}}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}+1\right)} \\
&= \frac{nR^{n-1}\pi^{\frac{n}{2}}}{\frac{n}{2}\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)} \\
&= \frac{2R^{n-1}\pi^\frac{n}{2}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
**** Implications
***** Small Dimensions
#+caption: Note the global maximum, after which the content quickly decreases.
[[/img/math/n-ball-graph.png]]

We shall ignore the "unit" of content and instead compare contents as
dimenionless quantities. The integer dimension that maximizes the content of the
unit ball is evidently $n = 5$. The figure reveals that this maximum is actually
at $n \approx 5.26$. In fact, the global maximum of the function $n\mapsto
\frac{R^n\pi^\frac{n}{2}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}+1\right)}, n \ge 0$ depends on
$R$ and is given by
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{\d}{\d n}\left(\frac{R^n\pi^\frac{n}{2}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}+1\right)}\right) &= 0\\
\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}+1\right)(R\sqrt{\pi})^n\ln(R\sqrt{\pi}) - \frac{1}{2}(R\sqrt{\pi})^n\Gamma'\left(\frac{n}{2}+1\right)}{\Gamma^2\left(\frac{n}{2}+1\right)} &= 0 \\
\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}+1\right)\ln(R\sqrt{\pi}) - \frac{1}{2}\Gamma'\left(\frac{n}{2}+1\right) &= 0 \\
\ln(\pi R^2) &= \frac{\Gamma'\left(\frac{n}{2}+1\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}+1\right)}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
This equation cannot be solved for $n$ analytically, so we approximate. From
Theorem 3, we have
\begin{equation}
\ln n < \frac{\Gamma'(n+1)}{\Gamma(n+1)} < \ln n + \frac{1}{n},
\end{equation}
which means that the maximal content of a ball of radius $R$ is attained in
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\ln\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) &\sim \ln(\pi R^2) \\
n &\sim 2\pi R^2.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
***** Large Dimensions
For a given radius $R$, the content of an $n$-ball goes to 0 as $n$ goes to
infinity. That is,
\begin{equation}
\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{R^n\pi^\frac{n}{2}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}+1\right)} = 0.
\end{equation}
In fact, this result holds for any expression of the form
$\frac{a^n}{\Gamma(kn + 1)} = \frac{a^n}{(kn)!}$ for positive real $a$ and $k$.
Define the function $f(n) = \frac{a^n}{(kn)!}$. Consider the limiting ratio
$\frac{f(n+1)}{f(n)}$:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\frac{a^{n+1}}{(k(n+1))!}}{\frac{a^n}{(kn)!}} &= \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{a^{n+1}(kn)!}{a^n(kn+k)!} \\
&= \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{a}{(kn + 1)(kn + 2)\cdots(kn + k)} \\
&= 0.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Then by the ratio test, the series $\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{a^n}{(kn)!}$
converges because its limiting ratio is 0. Because the terms of a convergent
series must tend to 0, $\frac{a^n}{(kn)!}$ tends to 0. Thus we have proven that
for a given $R$, $V_n(R)$ tends to $0$ as $n$ increases).
**** Conclusion
Our most important result was a general expression for the content of an
$n$-ball of radius $R$:
\begin{equation}
V_n(R) = \frac{R^n\pi^\frac{n}{2}}{\Gamma(\frac{n}{2}+1)}.
\end{equation}
We also derived two useful identities related to the gamma function:
\begin{equation}
\Gamma(2z) = \frac{2^{2z-1}\Gamma(z)\Gamma\left(z + \frac{1}{2}\right)}{\sqrt{\pi}}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\ln x - \frac{1}{x} < \frac{\Gamma'(x)}{\Gamma(x)} < \ln x.
\end{equation}
Our next steps would be to examine the properties of other geometric figures in
$n$ Euclidean dimensions, such as hypercubes and simplices. We could also
analyze balls in non-Euclidean spaces, such as hyperbolic space.

The $n$-th harmonic number is defined as the sum of reciprocals of the first $n$
natural numbers:
\begin{equation}
\sum\limits_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k}.
\end{equation}
We wish to prove the following identity involving harmonic numbers and binomial

\begin{equation}
\sum\limits_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k} = -\sum\limits_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k}\binom{n}{k}(-1)^k.
\label{identity}
\end{equation}
I have two solutions: one with calculus, and one by induction.
**** Calculus
First, we notice that
\begin{equation}
\int_0^1 x^{k-1} \d x = \frac{x^k}{k} \Biggr\rvert_0^1 = \frac{1}{k} - \frac{0}{k} = \frac{1}{k}.
\label{integral-rep}
\end{equation}
Then, substituting \eqref{integral-rep} into \eqref{identity} gives
\begin{equation}
\sum\limits_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k} = \sum\limits_{k=1}^n \int_0^1 x^{k-1} \d x.
\end{equation}
Because this is a finite sum of converging integrals, we can switch the sum and
the integral to get
\begin{equation}
\int_0^1 \sum\limits_{k=1}^n x^{k-1} \d x.
\end{equation}
This sum is a geometric series! We can use the formula for the $n$-th partial
sum of a geometric series.
\begin{equation}
1 + x + x^2 + \cdots + x^{n-1} = \frac{1 - x^n}{1-x}.
\end{equation}
Then we can solve the integral, using the substitution $x = 1-u, \d x = -\d u$.
\begin{equation}
\int_0^1 \frac{1 - x^n}{1-x} \d x = -\int_1^0 \frac{1 - (1-u)^n}{u} \d u \\
\end{equation}
Now the motivation for substituting $x = 1-u$ becomes clear. We can expand the
$(1-u)^n$ term using the binomial theorem:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
-\int_1^0 \frac{1 - (1-u)^n}{u} \d u &= \int_0^1 \frac{1}{u}\left( 1 - \sum\limits_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}(-1)^ku^k \right) \d x \\
&= -\int_0^1 \frac{1}{u}\left(\sum\limits_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}(-1)^ku^k - 1 \right) \d x \\
&= -\int_0^1 \frac{1}{u}\sum\limits_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k}(-1)^ku^k \d x \\
&= -\int_0^1 \sum\limits_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k}(-1)^ku^{k-1} \d x \\
&= -\sum\limits_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k}(-1)^k\int_0^1 u^{k-1} \d x \\
&= -\sum\limits_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k}\binom{n}{k}(-1)^k.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
This concludes our proof of \eqref{identity}.
**** Induction
We first show that
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{k+1}\binom{n}{k} = \frac{1}{n+1}\binom{n+1}{k+1}.
\label{lemma-1}
\end{equation}
We can expand the binomial coefficients with their factorial representation.
Then the left-hand side equals
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{k+1}\binom{n}{k} = \frac{1}{k+1}\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \frac{n!}{(k+1)!(n-k)!},
\end{equation}
while the right-hand side equals
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{n+1}\binom{n+1}{k+1} = \frac{1}{n+1}\frac{(n+1)!}{(k+1)!(n-k)!} = \frac{n!}{(k+1)!(n-k)!}.
\end{equation}
So \eqref{lemma-1} holds. Next we show that
\begin{equation}
\sum\limits_{k=0}^n \frac{1}{k+1} \binom{n}{k} (-1)^k = \frac{1}{n+1}.
\label{lemma-2}
\end{equation}
We use \eqref{lemma-1}:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\sum\limits_{k=0}^n \frac{1}{k+1}  \binom{n}{k} (-1)^k &= \sum\limits_{k=0}^n \frac{1}{n+1}\binom{n+1}{k+1} (-1)^k \\
&= -\frac{1}{n+1}\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n+1} \binom{n+1}{k} (-1)(-1)^{k} \\
&= -\frac{1}{n+1}\left(\sum\limits_{k=0}^{n+1} \binom{n+1}{k} (-1)^k - \binom{n+1}{0}(-1)^0 \right) \\
&= -\frac{1}{n+1}\left(0 - 1 \right) \\
&= \frac{1}{n+1}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We can now use induction to prove our main claim. Let's first show the base case
for $n = 1$. The left side of \eqref{identity} is clearly $1$, while the right
side is $-(-1) = 1$. So the base case holds. Assume inductively that
\begin{equation}
\sum\limits_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k} = -\sum\limits_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k}\binom{n}{k}(-1)^k.
\end{equation}
Then we wish to show that
\begin{equation}
\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n+1} \frac{1}{k} = -\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n+1} \frac{1}{k}\binom{n+1}{k}(-1)^k.
\end{equation}
We have
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
-\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n+1} \frac{1}{k}\binom{n+1}{k}(-1)^k &= -\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k}\binom{n+1}{k}(-1)^k - \frac{1}{n+1}\binom{n+1}{n+1}(-1)^{n+1} \\
&= -\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k}\binom{n+1}{k}(-1)^k + \frac{1}{n+1}(-1)^{n}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Using a standard identity of binomial coefficients
\begin{equation}
\binom{n}{k} + \binom{n}{k+1} = \binom{n+1}{k+1}
\end{equation}
(a recurrence relation that is the defining feature of Pascal's triangle) yields
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
&\frac{1}{n+1}(-1)^{n} - \sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} \binom{n}{k}\frac{1}{k}(-1)^k - \sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} \binom{n}{k-1}\frac{1}{k}(-1)^k \\
&\qquad = \frac{1}{n+1}(-1)^{n} - \sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} \binom{n}{k}\frac{1}{k}(-1)^k + \sum\limits_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{n}{k}\frac{1}{k+1}(-1)^k \\
&\qquad = \frac{1}{n+1}(-1)^{n} - \sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} \binom{n}{k}\frac{1}{k}(-1)^k + \sum\limits_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k}\frac{1}{k+1}(-1)^k - \binom{n}{n}\frac{1}{n+1}(-1)^n.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Applying \eqref{lemma-2} yields
\begin{equation}
- \sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} \binom{n}{k}\frac{1}{k}(-1)^k + \frac{1}{n+1}.
\end{equation}
By the inductive hypothesis, we have
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
- \sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} \binom{n}{k}\frac{1}{k}(-1)^k + \frac{1}{n+1} &= \sum\limits_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k} + \frac{1}{n+1} \\
&= \sum\limits_{k=1}^{n+1} \frac{1}{k},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
which closes the induction.

:EXPORT_DESCRIPTION: Heron’s formula tells us how to find the area of a triangle given its side lengths. We find the analogous expression for quadrilaterals, known as Bramhagupta’s Formula. It turns out quadrilaterals have maximal area when they are cyclic.
:END:
A well-known fact in Euclidean geometry is the following expression for the area
of a triangle given its side lengths:
\begin{equation}
A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)},
\end{equation}
where $s$ is the semiperimeter of the triangle, $\frac{a+b+c}{2}$. Our goal is
to generalize this formula to quadrilaterals. Just like in proofs of Heron's
formula that use trigonometry, we will use the formula for the area of a
triangle
\begin{equation}
A = \frac{1}{2}ab\sin C
\end{equation}
and the cosine law. Our strategy will be to square these expressions and use the
Pythagorean trigonometric identity. Consider a quadrilateral $ABCD$ with side
lengths $a,b,c,d$.
#+attr_html: :width 400px
[[/img/math/herons-quadrilateral.png]]

Then its area is the sum of the areas of the triangles $ABD$ and $BCD$. Let $A$
denote the area of quadrilateral $ABCD$. Then
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
A &= \text{Area}_{\triangle ABD} + \text{Area}_{\triangle BCD} \\
A &= \frac{1}{2}ad\sin\alpha + \frac{1}{2}bc\sin\beta \\
2A &= ad\sin\alpha + bc\sin\beta \\
4A^2 &= a^2d^2\sin^2\alpha + b^2c^2\sin^2\beta.
\end{split}
\label{sin}
\end{equation}
Using the cosine law on triangles $ABD$ and $BCD$, we obtain two expressions for
the square of the length of line segment $BD$:
\begin{equation}
BD^2 = a^2 + d^2 - 2ad\cos\alpha
\label{abd-cos}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
BD^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\cos\beta.
\label{bcd-cos}
\end{equation}
We equate the right sides of \eqref{abd-cos} and \eqref{bcd-cos} to obtain
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
a^2 + d^2  - 2ad\cos\alpha &= b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\cos\beta \\
a^2 + d^2 - b^2 - c^2 &= 2ad\cos\alpha - 2bc\cos\beta \\
\frac{a^2 + d^2 - b^2 - c^2}{2} &= ad\cos\alpha - bc\cos\beta \\
\frac{(a^2 + d^2 - b^2 - c^2)^2}{4} &= a^2d^2\cos^2\alpha + b^2c^2\cos^2\beta - 2abcd\cos\alpha\cos\beta.
\end{split}
\label{cos}
\end{equation}
We add \eqref{sin} and \eqref{cos}:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
4A^2 + \frac{(a^2 + d^2 - b^2 - c^2)^2}{4} &= a^2d^2\sin^2\alpha + b^2c^2\sin^2\beta + a^2d^2\cos^2\alpha + b^2c^2\cos^2\beta - 2abcd\cos\alpha\cos\beta \\
&= a^2d^2 + b^2c^2 - 2abcd\cos\alpha\cos\beta \\
&= (ad + bc)^2 - 2abcd - 2abcd\cos\alpha\cos\beta \\
&= (ad + bc)^2 - 2abcd(1 + \cos\alpha\cos\beta) \\
&= (ad + bc)^2 - 4abcd\left(\frac{1 + \cos\alpha\cos\beta}{2}\right).
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Using the cosine double angle formula, we have
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\cos2\theta &= \cos^2\theta - \sin^2\theta \\
\cos2\theta &= 2\cos^2\theta - 1 \\
1 + \cos2\theta &= 2\cos^2\theta \\
\frac{1 + \cos2\theta}{2} &= \cos^2\theta \\
\frac{1 + \cos\theta}{2} &= \cos^2\frac{\theta}{2}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We can substitute this into our equation for $4A^2$ to continue:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
4A^2 &= (ad + bc)^2 - 4abcd\cos^2\frac{\alpha + \beta}{2} - \frac{(a^2 + d^2 - b^2 - c^2)^2}{4} \\
16A^2 &= 4(ad + bc)^2 - (a^2 + d^2 - b^2 - c^2)^2 - 16abcd\cos^2\frac{\alpha + \beta}{2} \\
&= (2ad+2bc + a^2 + d^2 - b^2 - c^2)(2ad+2bc - a^2 - d^2 + b^2 + c^2) - 16abcd\cos^2\frac{\alpha + \beta}{2} \\
&= ((a+d)^2 - (b-c)^2)((b+c)^2 - (a-d)^2) - 16abcd\cos^2\frac{\alpha + \beta}{2} \\
&= (-a+b+c+d)(a-b+c+d)(a+b-c+d)(a+b+c-d) - 16abcd\cos^2\frac{\alpha + \beta}{2} \\
&= 16\left(\frac{-a+b+c+d}{2}\right)\left(\frac{a-b+c+d}{2}\right)\left(\frac{a+b-c+d}{2}\right)\left(\frac{a+b+c-d}{2}\right) - 16abcd\cos^2\frac{\alpha + \beta}{2}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We introduce $s = \frac{a+b+c+d}{2}$, the semiperimeter of the quadrilateral.
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
16A^2 &= 16(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d) - 16abcd\cos^2\frac{\alpha + \beta}{2} \\
A &= \sqrt{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d) - abcd\cos^2\frac{\alpha + \beta}{2}}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
And we have a formula for the area of an arbitrary quadrilateral given its side
lengths (this formula is called Bramhagupta's formula). It looks an awful lot
like Heron's formula; it just has a pesky $-abcd\cos^2\frac{\alpha + \beta}{2}$
term. Let's try getting rid of that term, which would maximize the area of the
quadrilateral. We want $\cos^2\frac{\alpha + \beta}{2}$ to be $0$, so we set
$\alpha + \beta = \pi$. This is true if the quadrilateral is cyclic. And so we
have discovered that, given four side lengths, we can form the quadrilateral
with the maximum area if we arrange the lengths such that opposite angles are
supplementary (if we make a cyclic quadrilateral).
*** Comparing $e^\pi$ and $\pi^e$                            :calculus:fun:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: e-pi
:EXPORT_DATE: 2018-02-01
:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :shorttitle "Comparing Powers of e and pi"
:EXPORT_DESCRIPTION: "Which is greater: e^pi or pi^e? No calculators allowed! I solve this puzzle with differentiation, Taylor series, concavity, and the AM-GM inequality."
:END:
The constants $e$ and $\pi$ are everywhere in mathematics. Determining the
greater of the two expressions $e^\pi$ and $\pi^e$ (without using a calculator,
of course...) is a fun puzzle that you can approach in many ways. I'd like to
discuss my solutions.
**** Differentiation
We shall perform the same operations on the two expressions.
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        e^{\pi} &\odot \pi^e \\
        e^{\frac{\pi}{e}} &\odot \pi^{\frac{e}{e}} \\
        e^{\frac{1}{e}} &\odot \pi^{\frac{1}{\pi}}
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
To show that $e^\pi > \pi^e$, it suffices to show that $e^{\frac{1}{e}} >
\pi^{\frac{1}{\pi}}$. Let $y = x^{\frac{1}{x}}$. Then we can implicitly
differentiate to find the critical points.
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\ln{y} &= \ln{x^{\frac{1}{x}}} \\
\ln{y} &= \frac{\ln{x}}{x} \\
\diff{}{x}\ln{y} &= \diff{}{x}\frac{\ln{x}}{x} \\
\frac{1}{y}y' &= \frac{x\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) - \ln{x}\cdot1}{x^2} \\
y' &= x^{\frac{1}{x}}\frac{1 - \ln{x}}{x^2}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The expressions $x^{\frac{1}{x}}$ and $x^2$ are always positive, so there is
only critical point: when $1 - \ln{x} = 0$, or when $x = e$. We must find
whether this point is a global minimum or a maximum. When $x = 1 < e$, we have
$1 - \ln{x} = 1$, so the function is increasing. The value $x = e^2 > e$ gives
$1 - \ln{x} = -1$, which means the function is decreasing. Thus
$x^{\frac{1}{x}}$ has a global maximum at $x = e$. And so $e^{\frac{1}{e}} >
\pi^{\frac{1}{\pi}}$, which shows that $e^\pi > \pi^e$.
**** Inequality
If we use the inequality $1 + x < e^x$ (I will present three proofs of this
below), then a very simple solution presents itself. The equality holds for all
$x$, but we only require it to hold for positive $x$. Make the substitution $x =
\frac{\pi}{e} - 1$, in an effort to cancel out the 1 on the right side of the
inequality and introduce $\pi$. Because $\pi > e$, $\frac{\pi}{e} - 1 > 0$, and
so
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        1 + \frac{\pi}{e} - 1 &< e^{\frac{\pi}{e} - 1} \\
    \pi\cdot\frac{1}{e} &< e^{\frac{\pi}{e}} \cdot \frac{1}{e} \\
\pi &< e^{\frac{\pi}{e}}\\
\pi^e &< e^\pi.
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
Wonderful, isn't it?
***** Taylor Series
This is the most standard proof I have; I think it's the least exciting. We only
prove the equality for positive $x$. We know
\begin{equation}
e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots
\end{equation}
Thus for $x > 0$, all the terms on the right side will be positive, and so $e^x
> 1 + x$.
***** Concavity
This method requires a little more "geometric intuition" than the last. At $x =
0$, we have $e^x = 1$. At this point $(0,1)$, the tangent line to $e^x$ has
slope $1$ and has the equation $y = 1 + x$. Because $(e^x)'' = e^x > 0$, $e^x$
is always concave up, so it is always above its tangent line. Therefore, $1 + x
< e^x$.
***** AM-GM
This is my favourite proof. It's a little less intuitive than the others, but I
think it's beautiful. We use the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality.
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
     \sqrt[n]{1+x} &= \sqrt[n]{\smash[b]{\underbrace{1\cdot1\cdots1}_{\text{$n-1$ times}}\cdot(1+x)}} \\\\[1em]
     &\le \frac{\overbrace{1+\dotsb+1}^{\text{$n-1$ times}}+(1+x)}{n} \\
     &= \frac{\overbrace{1+\dotsb+1}^{\text{$n$ times}}+x}{n} \\
    &= 1 + \frac{x}{n}.
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
Strict equality in the AM-GM inequality only holds when all the terms are equal.
In this case, $x > 0$, so $1 + x \neq 1$, so we have strict inequality. This
gives $\sqrt[n]{1+x} < 1 + \frac{x}{n}$. Raising both sides to the $n$-th power
gives
\begin{equation}
    1 + x < \left(1 + \frac{x}{n}\right)^n.
\end{equation}
Taking the limit as $n$ approaches $\infty$ on both sides yields
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \lim_{n\to\infty} (1 + x) &< \lim_{n\to\infty} \left(1 + \frac{x}{n}\right)^n \\
        1 + x &< e^x.
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
Using the limit definition of $e$, we conclude our proof.

I get the feeling that there are many other ways to attack this problem. If you
can solve it with a method that I have not shown, please let me know!

Welcome to the homepage of my [[https://projecteuler.net/][Project Euler]] solutions. Once I solve the original
problem, I also take on the modified version from [[https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges][ProjectEuler+]] on HackerRank,
where the problems usually have multiple, harder test cases. The time limits are
much stricter, and brute force is rarely an option.
*** Why do I publish my solutions?
After you solve a problem, Project Euler shows the following text:

I don’t quite agree. As anyone else, I learn the vast majority of what I know
from other people. Someone on my site looking at my solutions decided to look
for help on the greatest source of information we have: the Internet. So I’m
glad to do my part in helping someone else learn.

At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter whether the answer is 27189 or 27819;
the process is what counts, and that’s what I try to share. That’s why I share
my algorithms and code (and the process of coming up with them), but never a big

*** Problem Statement
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get
3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below $n$.
*** My Algorithm
The sum of the natural numbers up to $n$ is the \(n\)-th [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number][triangular
number]]. Let's call this $T(n)$. A well known formula for this is
\begin{equation}
T(n) = \sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}.
\label{triangular-num}
\end{equation}
The sum of all multiples of 3 below $n$ looks like this:
\begin{equation}
1\cdot3 + 2\cdot 3 + 3 \cdot 3 + \ldots + \floor{\frac{n-1}{3}} \cdot 3.
\label{3-list}
\end{equation}
We can factor 3 out and write \eqref{3-list} as $3T\left(\floor{\frac{n-1}{3}}\right)$, which
we know how to find with \eqref{triangular-num}. We can do the same thing
with 5.

But now we've overcounted! Each multiple of 15 under $n$ has been counted twice:
once as a multiple of 3, then again as a multiple of 5. We can fix this by
subtracting the sum of all multiples of 15 under $n$. And so our desired answer
is
\begin{equation}
3T\left(\floor{\frac{n-1}{3}}\right) + 5T\left(\floor{\frac{n-1}{5}}\right) - 15T\left(\floor{\frac{n-1}{15}}\right),
\end{equation}
with complexity $O(1)$.
**** Other Solutions
A brute-force solution that adds each number $i$ from 1 to $n-1$ to a count if
$i$ is divisible by 3 /or/ 5 would have time complexity $O(n)$. With the large
input sizes of the Hackerrank problem ($n \le 10^9$) this solution is too slow,
but it easily passes the original Project Euler problem, where $n = 1000$.

*** Problem Statement
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two
terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
\begin{equation*}
	1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89,\ldots
\end{equation*}
Find the sum of the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence not exceeding $N$.
*** My Algorithm
For the Project Euler problem, $N = 4\times10^6$. Let's list the Fibonacci
numbers with $F(0) = 0$:
\begin{equation}
	0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,\ldots
\end{equation}
Using the definition of the Fibonacci sequence:
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		F(n+3) &= F(n + 2) + F(n + 1) \\
		&= F(n + 1) + F(n) + F(n + 1) \\
		&= 2F(n + 1) + F(n).
	\end{split}
	\label{fib-sum}
\end{equation}
This shows that if $F(n)$ is even, then so is $F(n+3)$. Because $F(0) = 0$ is
even, then the even Fibonacci numbers are $F(3k)$ for positive integers $k$.

Further applying the Fibonacci recurrence relation gives
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		F(3k) &= 2F(3k - 2) + F(3k - 3) \\
		&= 3F(3k - 3) + 2F(3k - 4) \\
		&= 3F(3k - 3) + 2F(3k - 5) + 2F(3k - 6).
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
From \eqref{fib-sum}, we have $F(3k - 3) = 2F(3k - 5) + F(3k - 6)$, so
\begin{equation}
	F(3k) = 4F(3k - 3) + F(3k - 6) = 4F(3(k-1)) + F(3(k-2)).
	\label{next-fib}
\end{equation}
To solve the problem, we begin with $0,2$. Using \eqref{next-fib}, we add to a
sum the next even Fibonacci number, keeping track of the last two even Fibonacci
numbers. We continue this until the next even Fibonacci number exceeds $N$. This
solution performs one-third as many steps as there are Fibonacci numbers up to
$N$, so it is $O(\log n)$.
**** Other Solutions
Only computing even Fibonacci numbers does not change the
time complexity of the solution, but it does shave off a constant factor of 3.
**** Mathematical Solution
A more mathematically oriented $O(1)$ solution (my personal favourite) is also
possible. Unfortunately, the floating point calculations involved become too
inaccurate with large values of $N$, and using a high precision floating point
library (such as Python's ~decimal~) is too slow. Regardless, a famous formula
for the value of the $n$-th Fibonacci number is Binet's formula:
\begin{equation}
	F(n) = \frac{\varphi^n - (-\varphi)^{-n}}{\sqrt{5}}.
\end{equation}

Suppose we know that we need to sum the Fibonacci numbers $F(3k)$ for integers
$k$ from 0 to some maximum $M$ to get our desired sum $S$. Then we have two
geometric series:
\begin{equation}
	S = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left(\sum_{k=0}^M \varphi^{3k} - \sum_{k=0}^M (-\varphi)^{-(3k)}\right).
	\label{sum}
\end{equation}
We can find the first term of each series by setting $k = 0$; they are both 1.
In the first series, the common ratio is $\varphi^3$, in the second
$(-\varphi)^{-3}$. We use the formula for the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series#Formula][sum of a geometric series]] with
first term $a$ and common ratio $r$ with $n$ terms:
\begin{equation}
	a + ar + ar^3 + \cdots + ar^{n-1} = a\left(\frac{r^n - 1}{r-1}\right).
\end{equation}
Now we can rewrite \eqref{sum}, noting that each sum contains the first $M+1$
terms of a geometric series:
\begin{equation}
	S = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left( \frac{\varphi^{3(M+1)} - 1}{\varphi^3 - 1} + \frac{(-\varphi)^{-3(M+1)} - 1}{\varphi^{-3} + 1} \right).
	\label{sum2}
\end{equation}
It's nice to have from a mathematical point of view, but the second term in
\eqref{sum2} quickly vanishes. Excluding it gives an absolute error of less than
1, so we can ignore it and floor the expression:
\begin{equation}
	S = \left\lfloor \frac{\varphi^{3(M+1)} - 1}{\sqrt{5}(\varphi^3 - 1)} \right\rfloor.
\end{equation}

Now we need to find what this maximum $M$ actually is. We know that $F(3M)$ is
the largest even Fibonacci number less than or equal to $N$. Using the truncated
version of Binet's formula, we know that
\begin{equation}
	F(n) \approx \frac{\varphi^n}{\sqrt{5}},
\end{equation}
so $n \approx \log_\varphi(\sqrt{5} F(n))$. Therefore, $M \approx
\left\lfloor\frac{1}{3}\log_\varphi(N\sqrt{5})\right\rfloor$. And so our desired
answer is
\begin{equation}
	S = \left\lfloor \frac{\varphi^{3\left(\left\lfloor\frac{1}{3}\log_\varphi(N\sqrt{5})\right\rfloor+1\right)} - 1}{\sqrt{5}(\varphi^3 - 1)} \right\rfloor.
\end{equation}

*** Problem Statement
The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29. What is the largest prime factor of
a given number $N$?
*** My Algorithm
Splitting $n$ into two factors gives one at least $\sqrt{n}$ and one at most
$\sqrt{n}$. To see this, suppose not; if both were strictly less than
$\sqrt{n}$, then their product would be strictly less than $n$, and if both were
strictly greater, so would their product. Of course, $n$ can't be greater than
or less than itself.

This is a very valuable fact. It means that if $n$ is not divisible by a prime
at most $\sqrt{n}$, then $n$ is itself prime. So if we have a list of the primes
under $\sqrt{n}$, and divide $n$ as much as we can by each of them, then what is
left is either 1 or the largest prime factor of $n$. In the first case, the
answer is the largest prime that divided $n$, which we can keep track of.

To generate the list of primes, we can use the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes][Sieve of Eratosthenes]]. We start
with a list of the first $m$ numbers. We cross out all the multiples of 2, then
go to the next uncrossed number, and cross out all of its multiples. When we
cannot cross out any more numbers, we are left with the primes less than or
equal to $m$. The time complexity of this operation is $O(m\log\log m)$. There
are about $\frac{m}{\log m}$ primes under $m$, according to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem][Prime Number
Theorem]]. In our case, $m = \sqrt{n}$. And so the time complexity of our solution
is $O(\sqrt{n}\log \log \sqrt{n} + \frac{\sqrt{n}}{\log n}) = O(\sqrt{n} \log
\log n)$.
**** Other Solutions
Because we only need the /largest/ prime factor, an $O(\sqrt{n})$ solution is
possible. The largest factor of $n$ must be prime. So we check whether each
numbers up to $\sqrt{n}$ divides $n$ and keep track of the largest so far that
does, which is our answer. However, the solution above gives more generally
applicable techniques and can also be used to find the $k$-th largest prime
factor.

We compute all products $ij$ of numbers $100 \le i,j \le 999$ and keep the
palindromic ones. Then we sort the palindromic products and perform a binary

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to
10 without any remainder. What is the smallest positive number that is evenly
divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to $N$?
*** My Algorithm
For a number $a$ to divide another number $b$, each of the prime powers that
divide $a$ must also divide $b$. That is, the exponent on each of the prime
powers that divide $a$ is less than or equal to the corresponding exponent on a
prime power that divides $b$. For each number from 1 to $N$ to divide a number
$M$, each prime power less than $N$ must also divide $M$. To minimize $M$, we
have each prime $p \le N$ divide $M$ as many times as it does the largest prime
power of $p$ at most $N$. That is
\begin{equation}
M = \prod_{p \le N} p^{\lfloor \log_pN \rfloor}.
\end{equation}
To compute our answer $M$, we need a list of the primes less than $N$, for which
we can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes. And so our solution has time complexity
$O(n\log\log n)$.
**** Other Solutions
This problem can also be phrased as finding the lowest common multiple of
$1,\ldots,N$, for which the classic formula is $\mathrm{lcm}(1,\ldots,N) =
\frac{N!}{\mathrm{gcd}(1,\ldots,N)}$. Because the numerator grows very quickly,
we can compute the LCM iteratively, making use of the fact that
$\mathrm{lcm}(a,b,c) = \mathrm{lcm}(\mathrm{lcm}(a,b),c)$ and storing the latest
LCM with each step. This algorithm computes the greatest common denominator of
two numbers at most $N$, which can be done in $O(\log n)$ time, $N$ times. And
so this solution has time complexity $O(n\log n)$. However, it has much better
space complexity, at $O(1)$, than the sieve of Eratosthenes, which needs $O(n)$
space to store an array of size $n$. So for large $n$, this alternative solution
is preferred.

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is

\end{equation*}
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is
\begin{equation*}
(1 + 2 + \cdots + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
\end{equation*}
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
numbers and the square of the sum is $3025 - 385 = 2640$. Find the absolute
difference between the sum of the squares of the first $N$ natural numbers and
the square of the sum.
*** My Algorithm
We make use of the following two formulas, which can be proven using induction.
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\label{1}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^n i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}.
\label{2}
\end{equation}
Applying these two formulas, the desired value $S$ is
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
S &= \Big| \frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4} - \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \Big| \\
&= \Big|\frac{n^4+2n^3+n^2}{4} - \frac{2n^3 + 3n^2 + n}{6} \Big| \\
&= \Big| \frac{3n^4+6n^3+3n^2}{12} - \frac{4n^3 + 6n^2 + 2n}{12} \Big| \\
&= \Big| \frac{3n^4+2n^3-3n^2-2n}{12} \Big| \\
\end{split}
\label{final-sum}
\end{equation}
This value is non-negative for $n > 0$, so the absolute value bars
are not necessary. Our algorithm is just a computation, so it has time
complexity $O(1)$.
**** Other Solutions
We did not need to simplify the expression as in \eqref{final-sum}; we could
have simply subtracted \eqref{2} from the square of \eqref{1}. An $O(n)$
solution is also possible: simply add the first $N$ numbers, square them, and
subtract the sum of the squares of the first $N$ numbers.

By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that

*** My Algorithm
We use the following identity, which is a consequence of the Prime Number
Theorem:
\begin{equation}
n(\log n + \log \log n - 1) < p_n < n(\log n + \log \log n), n > 5.
\end{equation}
If $n \le 5$, we use a look-up table. Using a Sieve of Eratosthenes, we generate
a list of the primes up to $n(\log n + \log \log n)$, which is guaranteed to
contain the $n$-th prime. Our answer is the $n$-th element of this array. We do
this with time complexity $O(n \log n \log \log (n \log n))$, using $p_n \approx
n \log n$. Because $O(\log \log (n \log n)) \in O(\log n)$, this can be
simpified to $O(n \log^2 n)$. To optimize the constant factor, we compute the
first $N_{\text{max}} = 10^4$ primes and store them in memory, rather than
computing the list for each query, which takes too long.

*** Problem Statement
A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, $a < b < c$, for which,
\begin{equation*}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\end{equation*}
For example, $3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52$. Given $N$, find the maximal product
$abc$ such that $a,b,c$ form a Pythagorean triplet for which $a+b+c = N$. If no
such triplet exists, output $-1$.
*** My Algorithm
We know
\begin{equation}
a + b + c = N
\label{1}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2.
\label{2}
\end{equation}
From \eqref{1} we get $c = N - a - b$, which we substitute into \eqref{2} to get
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
a^2 + b^2 &= (N - (a + b))^2 \\
a^2 + b^2 &= N^2 - 2N(a+b) + (a+b)^2 \\
a^2 + b^2 &= a^2 + b^2 + 2ab + N^2 - 2Na - 2Nb \\
0 &= b(2a - 2N) + N^2 - 2Na \\
b(2a - 2N) &= 2Na - N^2 \\
b &= \frac{N^2 - 2Na}{2N - 2a}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Now we have expressions for $b,c$ in terms of $a$. Also, because $a < b < c$ and
$a + b + c = N$, none of the side lengths can exceed $\frac{N}{3}$. Now we can
iterate over $1 \le a \le \frac{N}{3}$ and store the maximal product $abc$ for
which $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. This solution is $O(n)$.
**** Other Solutions
We can also brute force an $O(N^2 + T)$ solution, where $T$ is the
number of queries. For all $a < b < 3000$, we check whether $c = \sqrt{a^2 +
b^2}$ is an integer. If so, we check whether $abc$ is greater than our existing
answer for the perimeter $a + b + c$, which is by default $-1$. To answer the
queries, we look up the corresponding value in $O(1)$ time.

The product of these numbers is $26 \cdot 63 \cdot

the same direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) in the 20×20 grid?
*** My Algorithm
The important thing in this problem is to be careful of boundary conditions. We
start at the top left corner. If there are at least three cells to the right, we
check the horizontal product. If there are at least three cells down, we check
the vertical product. If there are at least three cells to the left and three
cells down, we check the left diagonal product. If there are at least three
cells to the right and three cells down, we check the right diagonal product.
Checking up, left, left-up, or right-up would be redundant. We take the maximum
of these four values and the existing maximum product and set that to be our new
maximum product. We continue like this over all cells in the grid. Our final
answer is found in $O(n^2)$ time---not surprising for a square grid.

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55,\ldots
\end{equation*}
What is the value of the first triangle number to have over $N$ divisors?
*** My Algorithm
If we prime factor a number $n$ as
\begin{equation}
p_1^{e_{1}}p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_n^{e_n},
\end{equation}
then we can write the number of factors of $n$ as
\begin{equation}
(e_1 + 1)(e_2+1) \cdots (e_n+1).
\label{factor-prod}
\end{equation}
The \(n\)-th triangular number is $\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = O(n^2)$. We could prime
factor this number in $O(n\log\log n)$ time. But because $n$ and $n+1$ are
always coprime, the number of factors of $n(n+1)$ is the product of the number
of factors of $n$ and $n+1$, which we can find in $O(\sqrt{n}\log\log n)$ time.

To find the number of factors of the \(n\)-th triangular number, we also need to
account for the factors lost by dividing by 2. Exactly one of $n$ and $n+1$ is
divisible by 2, so we need not factor $n(n+1)$. If the greatest power of 2 that
divides $n(n+1)$ is $2^k$, then the \(n\)-th triangular number has
$\frac{k}{k+1}$ fewer factors than $n(n+1)$.

We iterate over $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ until a number with more than $N$ divisors is
found. We can improve this solution by precomputing a sufficiently large list of
primes. W can decrease the constant factor in our algorithm by 2 if we cache
the number of prime factors of the last $n+1$ that we tested.

A rough upper bound on our time complexity is $O(M)$. First, we
generate the primes up to $\sqrt{M}$ with complexity $O(\sqrt{M}\log \log M)$.
Then we find the number of factors of a number at most $M$, and we do this
$M$ times. That is, for each of the $\frac{M}{\log M}$ primes $p$ we generated, we
find the number of times $p$ divides $M$, which is at most $\log_p M$. This
gives complexity $O(\sqrt{M}\log \log M + \frac{M}{\log M}\log M) = O(M)$.

This sequence contains 10 terms. It is conjectured that every starting number
produces a sequence that ends in 1. Which starting number at most $N$ produces
the longest chain? If there are many possible such numbers, print the maximum
one.
*** My Algorithm
This problem is perfect for caching (or memoization) and recursion. We define a
recursive function that returns the length of a Collatz chain with a given
starting number. The function also store the chain length for each starting
number (and, because the function is recursive, each number in the chain) in a
list so that we do not have to compute it again.

Because of memory constraints, we do not store chain lengths for numbers greater
than the maximum given $N$. Instead, we compute these values on the fly. We can
then iterate over all possible starting numbers and keep a list of starting
numbers which produce a right-maximal chain length (that is, they produce a
chain length greater than or equal to all lenghts produced by smaller starting
numbers). Finally, we perform a binary search for the greatest element in this
list less than each query. This solution has time complexity $O(M + T\log M)$,
where $M$ is the maximum possible starting value and $T$ is the number of
queries.

only travel to the right or down. How many routes are there to the bottom-right
corner? Output the answer modulo $10^9 + 7$.
*** My Algorithm
In total, we must make $N+M$ moves, of which $N$ are to the right. Choosing
these $N$ moves uniquely identifies each possible route, as this is equivalent
to choosing the $M$ downwards moves. This is a combinatorial explanation for the
fact that
\begin{equation}
\binom{N+M}{N} = \binom{N+M}{M} = \frac{(N+M)!}{N!M!}
\end{equation}
which is our answer. To make the computation easier, we use the smaller of $N$
and $M$. Suppose we know the value of $\binom{a}{b} = \frac{a!}{b!(a-b)!}$. Then
we can find the value of
\begin{equation}
\binom{a}{b+1} = \frac{a!}{(b+1)!(a-b-1)!} = \binom{a}{b}\frac{a-b}{b+1}
\label{recurrence}
\end{equation}
This gives us a recurrence relation. Because we are computing the answer modulo
$10^9 + 7$, we must use the modular multiplicative inverse of $b+1$. Because the
modulus is prime, this is guaranteed to exist.

Starting with $\binom{N+M}{0} = 1$, we iterate over $0 \le k \le
\mathrm{min}(N,M) - 1$ use the recurrence relation \eqref{recurrence},
multiplying by $N + M - k$ and the modular inverse of $k + 1$ under $P$. At each
step, we take the expression modulo $P$. Our solution has time complexity
$O(\mathrm{min}(N,M)\log P)$.

that the integer division of $N$ by $10^k$ removes the last k digits of $N$; and
second, that $N$ modulo $10^k$ returns the last $k$ digits of $N$. Now we define
a function that returns the name of a number with at most three digits. If $N$
is zero, we return an empty string. If $N$ is in our look-up table, we are done.
If not, we get the first digit, or hundreds digit. If it is non-zero, we add its
name and "hundred" to the array. Then we get the last two digits. If the
corresponding number is in the look-up table, we add it to the array. If not, we
find the tens digit and if it is non-zero, we add the name of the corresponding
multiple of ten (from our look-up table) to our array. Finally, we add the name
of the ones digit if it is non-zero. Then, we join together the three-digit name
with suffix for each block of three digits in the number. This solution has time
complexity $O(\log n)$. Because we process the number in blocks of three, the
constant factor is small.

*** Problem Statement
By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on
the row below, the maximal total from top to bottom is 23.
#+attr_html: :width 100px
#+caption: Note that \(3+7+4+9 = 23\).
[[/img/euler/18-triangle.png]]

Find the maximum path length for a given such triangle.
*** My Algorithm
We use a data structure that mimics the structure of a given triangle. For each
row, we update a ~parent~ array to store the maximal path sums that end in each
entry of the row above. We process each row of the tree into an array called
~current~. For each element =x= in the row, we add to current the sum of =x= and
the maximum of the sums corresponding to the two (or one) entries adjacent to =x=
in the previous row. These sums are found in ~parent~. When we finish processing a
row, we set =parent= equal to =current= and continue until all the rows have been
processed. The final answer is the maximal element in ~parent~. This solution has
time complexity $O(n^2)$, because we perform an operation for each element of
the triangle.
*** Other Solutions
A brute force solution is possible for small triangles. The number of paths is
the sum of the number of paths that end in each entry of the bottom row. This is
the sum of the entries in the $n$-th row of Pascal's triangle, or $2^n$. And so
a brute force solution would have time complexity $O(2^n)$.

*** Problem Statement
Let $d(n)$ be defined as the sum of proper divisors of $n$ (numbers less than
$n$ that divide evenly into $n$). If $d(a) = b$ and $d(b) = a$, where $a \neq
b$, then $a$ and $b$ are an amicable pair and each of $a$ and $b$ are amicable
numbers. For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22,
44, 55 and 110; therefore $d(220) = 284$. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2,
4, 71 and 142; so $d(284) = 220$. Evaluate the sum of the proper divisors under
$N$.
*** My Algorithm
The first thing we need is a way to calculate $d(n)$. We only need to check each
number less than $\sqrt{n}$. If it divides $n$, we add it to the sum that we
will return. We therefore find $d(n)$ in $O(\sqrt{n})$ time. Then we can use
preprocessing to answer each query in $O(1)$ time. For each $1 \le x \le
N_{\text{max}}$, if $x = d(d(x))$ and $x \neq d(x)$, then we add $x$ to a list
of amicable numbers. To answer each query, we simply add the amicable numbers
less than the given $N$. Our solution has time complexity $O(N\sqrt{N} + T)$,
where $N$ is the maximum possible input value and $T$ is the number of queries.

*** Problem Statement
You are given around five-thousand names. Begin by sorting them by alphabetical
order. Then working out the alphabetical value of each name, multiply this value
by the alphabetical position of the name in the list. For example, suppose ~COLIN~
is the 983rd element of a sorted list of names. It is worth $3 + 15 + 12 + 9 +
14 = 53$, so this name has a score of $53 \cdot 983 = 49714$. Give the name
score of the given names.
*** My Algorithm
We need two things to solve this problem: a way to get the score of a letter and
a way to get the alphabetical position of a name in the list. We can make a
string ~ABCDEFHGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ~ containing all the letters of the alphabet.
For each letter in a given name, we find the index of that letter in our string
and add one; this is the score of that letter. We sum the scores and multiply it
by the alphabetical position of a name, which is =i+1=, where =i= is its index
in the sorted list. In Python, sorting a list of strings is done in alphabetical
order. We sort the list of $n$ names in $O(n\log n)$ time, and we find the index
of a name in the list by linearly searching it in $O(n)$ time. The alphabetical
score is computed in $O(26) = O(1)$ time. This solution has time complexity
$O(n\log n + Qn)$.
*** Other Solutions
Because we sort the list of names, we could use binary search to find the
alphabetical position of a given name. This would improve our time complexity to
$O(n\log n + Q\log n)$. In the HackerRank problem, $Q < n$, but even if $Q$ were
greater than $n$, then some names would be queried more than once. In this case,
instead of recalculating the score, we could cache each score as it is
calculated. And so binary search reduces the complexity of this solution to just
the sorting time, $O(n \log n)$.

*** Problem Statement
A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is exactly
equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper divisors of 28 would be
1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 28 is a perfect number. A number $n$
is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than $n$ and it is
called abundant if this sum exceeds $n$. As 12 is the smallest abundant number,
$1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16$, the smallest number that can be written as the sum of
two abundant numbers is 24. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all
integers greater than 28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.
However, this upper limit cannot be reduced any further by analysis even though
it is known that the greatest number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two
abundant numbers is less than this limit. Given $N$, print ~YES~ if it can be
written as the sum of two abundant numbers. Otherwise, print ~NO~.
*** My Algorithm
We calculate $d(n)$ with trial division up to $\sqrt{n}$ as in [[../21/][Project Euler 21]]. We
then make a list of abundant numbers by checking each number up to 28123,
because any abundant number above this will not help us solve the problem. To
answer the problem, we need a function to decide whether a number $n$ can be
written as the sum of two abundant numbers. If $n > 28123$, we print ~YES~; we are
given this information in the problem, and without it, our solution is too slow
to pass. We make a new list whose elements are $n - a$ for an abundant number
$a$. If the intersection of this list and the list of abundant numbers is empty,
then we print =NO=; otherwise, we print =YES=. This solution has time complexity
$O(n\sqrt{n} + AT)$, where $T$ is the number of queries and $A$ is the number of
abundant numbers under 28123.

*** Problem Statement
A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, $\mathrm{dabc}$
is a permutation of the word $\mathrm{abcd}$. If the permutations are listed
alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order. The lexicographic permutations
of $\mathrm{abc}$ are:
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{abc}, \mathrm{acb}, \mathrm{bac}, \mathrm{bca}, \mathrm{cab}, \mathrm{cba}.
\end{equation*}
What is the $N$-th lexicographic permutation of the word
$\mathrm{abcdefghijklm}$?
*** My Algorithm
Suppose our word has $n$ letters. Then the first $(n-1)!$ lexicographic
permutations begin with $a$, the next $(n-1)!$ with $b$, and so on. Consider the
first $(n-1)!$ lexicographic permutations. They consist of $a$ followed by a
lexicographic permutation of the word without $a$. Of these, the first $(n-2)!$
begin with $b$. We can write $N$ as a unique sum
\begin{equation}
N = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i \cdot i!,
\end{equation}
where $0 \le c_i \le i + 1$. This is a kind of "base-factorial" expansion of
$N$. Once we do this, we use the procedure above. Starting from $n-1$ and going
down to $0$, the $N$-th lexicographic permutation has the \(c_{n-1}\)-th letter in
the first position, the \(c_{n-2}\)-th letter of those remaining in the second
position, and so on.

And so our algorithm is as follows. Write $N$ as a sum of factorials. Maintain
a list of the letters in the word, in alphabetical order. For $n-1 \ge i \ge 0$,
delete the $c_i$-th element from the list and add it to the string representing
the lexicographic permutation. This solution has time complexity $O(L)$, where
$L$ is the length of the given word.

*** Problem Statement
What is the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain $N$ digits?
*** My Algorithm
We will use Binet's formula for the $n$-th fibonacci number
\begin{equation}
F_n = \frac{\varphi^n - (-\varphi)^{-n}}{\sqrt{5}}.
\end{equation}
The $(-\varphi)^{-n}$ quickly becomes negligible. So we can make the
approximation
\begin{equation}
F_n \approx \frac{\varphi^n}{\sqrt{5}}.
\label{approx}
\end{equation}
A number $n$ has $\lfloor \log_{10} n \rfloor + 1$ digits. So we must solve the
following equation such that $n$ is minimized:
\begin{equation}
\lfloor \log_{10} F_n \rfloor + 1 = N.
\label{fib-eq}
\end{equation}
Recall that $\lfloor x \rfloor$ is defined as the greatest integer less or equal
to than $x$. That is,
\begin{equation}
x \le \lfloor x \rfloor < x + 1.
\label{floor}
\end{equation}
Applying \eqref{approx} and \eqref{floor} to \eqref{fib-eq} gives
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
N &\le 1 + \log_{10} F_n < N + 1 \\
N - 1 & \le \log_{10} \frac{\varphi^n}{\sqrt{5}} \\
N - 1 + \frac{\log_{10}5}{2} &\le n \log_{10} \varphi \\
\frac{N - 1 + \frac{\log_{10}5}{2}}{\log_{10}\varphi} &\le n.
\end{split}
\label{final}
\end{equation}
We see that $n$ is minimized when it is the smallest integer greater than the
left side of \eqref{final}. This is precisely the definition of the ceiling
function. And so we have our desired answer:
\begin{equation}
n = \left\lceil \frac{N - 1 + \frac{\log_{10}5}{2}}{\log_{10}\varphi} \right\rceil.
\end{equation}
Because our solution is just a computation, it has time complexity $O(1)$. In
our code, we just need to handle the corner case where $N = 1$; here our
approximation \eqref{approx} introduces enough error to return an incorrect
answer.

*** Problem Statement
Euler published the remarkable quadratic equation
\begin{equation*}
n^2 + 41n + 41.
\end{equation*}
It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer
values $0 \le n \le 39$. However, when $n = 40$, we have $40^2 + 40 + 41 =
41(40+1) + 41$, which is divisiblye by 41, and certainly when $n = 41$, the
expression $41^2 + 41 + 41$ is clearly divisible by 41. The incredible formula
$n^2 - 79n + 1601$ produces 80 primes for the consecutive values $0 \le n \le
79$. Considering quadratics of the form
\begin{equation*}
n^2 + an + b, \quad |a|,|b| \le N,
\end{equation*}
find the coefficients $a,b$ for the quadratic expression that produces the
maximum number of primes with consecutive values of $n$, starting with $n = 0$.
*** My Algorithm
A naive brute force search over all $-N \le a,b \le N$ is too slow. We make two
observations that exclude many cases. First, the expression $n^2 + an + b$ is
equal to $b$ when $n = 0$. Thus $b$ must be prime. Second, when $n = 1$, we have
$1 + a + b$. Above 2, $b$ is odd. So $a$ must also be odd; otherwise, the
expression is an even number greater than 2, which is not prime.

We need two things to proceed: a list of primes under $N$ and a way to check if
a given $n$ is prime. For the first, we use a Sieve of Eratosthenes, and for the
second, we use trial division up to $\sqrt{n}$. We iterate through odd $-N \le a
\le N$, which takes $N$ steps, and prime $-N \le b \le  N$, which takes about
$\frac{N}{\log N}$. Then, we compute the expression $n^2 + an + b$ until it is
not prime; we do this up to $N$ times, with time complexity $\sqrt{N}$ each
time. Including the sieve, our solution has time complexity
$O\left(N\cdot\frac{N}{\log N}\cdot N\sqrt{N} + \sqrt{N}\log\log N\right) =
O\left(\frac{N^3\sqrt{N}}{\log N}\right)$.

*** Problem Statement
Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction, a
5-by-5 spiral is formed:

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101. What is
the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in an $N \times N$ spiral ($N$ odd)?
Report your answer modulo $10^9 + 7$.
*** My Algorithm
We can think of the spiral as being made up of a central 1 surrounded by $n$
rings of side length $2n+1$, where $n = \frac{N - 1}{2}$. Let us derive a
formula for the sum of the numbers in the corners of each ring---these make up
the diagonals of the spiral. The number in the top-right corner of the $n$-th
ring is $(2n+1)^2$, the area of the ring. Going counter-clockwise, the number
decreases by one less than the side length, or $2n+1-1=2n$, each time. And so
the $n$-th ring has corner sum
\begin{equation}
4(2n+1)^2 - 6(2n) = 16n^2 + 4n + 4.
\end{equation}
To find the sum of the corners of all rings, we can use the formula for the sum
of the first $n$ natural numbers
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=0}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\end{equation}
and their squares:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}.
\end{equation}
To get the sum of the diagonals, we just add 1 to the sum of the corners, to
account for the central 1. And so our desired answer $S$ is
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
S &= 1 + \sum_{i=0}^{\frac{N-1}{2}} (16n^2 + 4n + 4) \\
&= 1 + 16\cdot\frac{\frac{N-1}{2}\left(\frac{N-1}{2} + 1\right)\left(2\cdot\frac{N-1}{2} + 1\right)}{6} + 4\cdot\frac{\frac{N-1}{2}\left(\frac{N-1}{2}+1\right)}{2} + 4\frac{N-1}{2} \\
&= 1 + 4\cdot\frac{(N-1)(N - 1 + 2)(N - 1 + 1)}{6} + \frac{(N-1)(N-1+2)}{2} + 2(N-1) \\
&= 1 + \frac{2N(N-1)(N+1)}{3} + \frac{(N-1)(N+1)}{2} + 2(N-1) \\
&= \frac{4N(N-1)(N+1) + 3(N-1)(N+1) + 12(N-1) + 6}{6} \\
&= \frac{4N^3 + 3N^2 + 8N - 9}{6}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We report our answer modulo $10^9 + 7$. Because there is a division by 6 in our
answer, we must use the multiplicative modular inverse of 6 modulo $10^9 + 7$,
which we find in $O(\log P)$ time. And so our solution has time complexity
$O(1)$.

Surprisingly, there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of

8208 &= 8^4 + 2^4 + 0^4 + 8^4 \\
9474 &= 9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
Note that because $1 = 1^4$ is not a sum, it is not included. The sum of these
numbers is $11634 + 8208 + 9474 = 9316$. Find the sum of all numbers that can be
written as the sum of $N$-th powers of their digits.
*** My Algorithm
The sum of the $N$-th powers of the digits of a number with $d$ digits is at
most $d\cdot9^N$. And so a hard upper bound on a number equal to the sum of the
$N$-th powers of its digits is $N\cdot9^N$. This number has $\lfloor \log_{10}
N + N\log_{10} 9 \rfloor + 1$ digits. Because the argument of the floor is never
a power of 10, this is equal to $\lceil \log_{10} N + N \log_{10} 9 \rceil$. So
we could check all numbers $11 \le n < 10^{\lceil \log_{10} N + N \log_{10} 9
\rceil}$. However, this is much too slow to pass $N = 6$. We know that any
number that fits the criteria is the sum of some combination (with replacement)
of integers in $0^N,1^N,\ldots,9^N$. And so we can check each combination with
replacement of $2 \le k \le \lceil \log_{10} N + N \log_{10} 9 \rceil$ elements
(this represents the number of digits) from this set of 10 $N$-th powers.

We can find these combinations using =combinations_with_replacement= from the
=itertools= package. We skip the case where $k = 1$ because, as stated in the
problem, the sum of the digits in a one-digit number is a degenerate sum. To
avoid counting duplicate combinations with extra 0s, we use multisets,
implemented with =Counter= from =collections=. A multiset is like a set, but
elements can appear more than once. Two multisets are equal if and only if they
contain the same elements the same number of times. We get the multiset of the
$N$-th roots of each combination. Then, we sum the elements of the combination
and find the multiset of digits of the sum. If these two multisets are equal, we
have found a valid solution.
**** Complexity Analysis
There are $\binom{n+k-1}{k}$ ways to choose $k$
elements with replacement from a pool of $n$ elements. In our case, $n = 10$. We
therefore perform
\begin{equation}
\sum\limits_{k=2}^{\lceil \log_{10} N9^N \rceil} \mkern-5mu \binom{9+k}{k}
\label{operations}
\end{equation}
operations. For $N = 6$, this turns out to be 19437---much less than the $10^7$
required by brute force.

Just for fun, let's do some upper bound analysis on
this expression. Using Stirling's approximation for $n!$, we find that
$\binom{n}{k} \le \frac{n^k}{k!}$. In our case, we have $\frac{(9+k)^k}{k!}
\approx \frac{k^k}{k!}$. The upper limit of our sum is $O(\log_{10} N +
N\log_{10} 9) \in O(N + \log_{10} N) \in O(N)$. And so our solution is
$O(\frac{N^N}{N!})$. This is not a tight upper bound; it grows much faster than
the exact number of operations given in \eqref{operations}.
**** Other Solutions
The brute force approach described above is sufficient to solve the original
Project Euler problem. It has complexity $O(N10^{N})$.

In England, the currency is made up of pounds (£) and pence (p), and there are
eight coins in general circulation: 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p), and £2
(200p). It is possible to make £2 in the following way:
\begin{equation*}
1\cdot\mathrm{£}1 + 1\cdot50\mathrm{p} + 2 \cdot 20\mathrm{p} + 1 \cdot 5\mathrm{p} + 1 \cdot 2\mathrm{p} + 3\cdot1\mathrm{p}
\end{equation*}
In how many ways can $N$ pence be made from any denomination of coins? Output
your answer modulo $10^9 + 7$.
*** My Algorithm
This problem is a classic application of dynamic programming, the technique of
breaking up a problem into smaller, reusable chunks. To make $N$ pence, we can
first make $N - c$ pence, then add one $c$ pence coin, where $c$ is the value of
some denomination. Then the number of ways we can make $N$ pence is the sum of
$N - c$ over all valid $c$.

Using this principle, our solution is simple. We maintain a list =coins= such that
=coins[n]= is the number of ways we can make $n$ pence, where $0 \le n \le N$.
Then, for each valid denomination of coins $c$, we loop over $c \le n \le N$ and
increment =~coins[n]= by =coins[n-c]=. At each step, we perform addition modulo
$10^9 + 7$. Because we maintain the list for all $0 \le n \le N_{\text{max}}$,
we can answer each query in $O(1)$ time. And so our solution has time complexity
$O(CN_{\text{max}} + T)$, where $C$ is the number of coins and $T$ is the number
of queries.

*** Problem Statement
We shall say that an $N$-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the

5 pandigital. The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity $39 \cdot 186 = 7254$
containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital. Find
the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be
written as a 1 through $N$ pandigital.
*** My Algorithm
We use a brute-force check on all ways of splitting up a pandigital number into
three non-empty parts. We can generate each pandigital number by finding the
permutations of a string with digits from $1$ to $N$. There are $N!$ of these.
It is then simple to verify whether the product of the first two parts is equal
to the third part.

Using the combinatorial technique of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars_and_bars_(combinatorics)][stars and bars]], we find that there are
$\binom{n-1}{k-1}$ ways to distribute $n$ indistinguishable objects among $k$
distinguishable groups. Our groups---the three parts---are distinguishable, as
their order matters. For a given pandigital number, the digits cannot move, so
they are thought of as indistinguishable. And so there are $\binom{N-1}{2}$ ways
of splitting up each pandigital number. We know
\begin{equation}
N! \binom{N-1}{2} = \frac{N!(N-1)!}{2(N-3)!} = \frac{N!(N-1)(N-2)}{2} \le \frac{N^2N!}{2}.
\end{equation}
And so our solution has time complexity $O(N^2N!)$.

*** Problem Statement
145 is a curious number, as $1! + 4! + 5! = 145$. Find the sum of all numbers
that are the sum of the factorials of their digits. Note that $1! = 1$ and $2! =
2$ are not sums, as they contain only one digit.
*** My Algorithm
We use a combinatorial approach similar to [[../30/][Project Euler 30]]. The sum of the factorials
of the digits of a number with $d$ digits is $d\cdot9!$. So the upper bound on
the number we need to check is $7\cdot9!$, because $8\cdot9!$ only has 7 digits.
This means we can test valid candidate sets of size $2 \le k \le 7$ chosen with
replacement from $0!,\ldots,9!$. Like in Project Euler 30, we use multisets to check
whether a combination is valid. And so we perform
\begin{equation}
\sum\limits_{k=2}^{7} \mkern-5mu \binom{9+k}{k} = 19347
\label{operations}
\end{equation}
operations, as in Project Euler 30.
**** HackerRank
The HackerRank problem is, for once, much easier than the original Project Euler
problem. It asks us to find the sum of all $n < N$ such that $n$ divides its
factorial digit sum. Because $N \le 10^5$, we can run a brute force search,
checking whether each $n < N$ is a valid solution.

*** Problem Statement
The number 197 is called a circular prime because all rotations of the digits
(197,719,917) are prime. There are thirteen such prime under 100: 2, 3, 5, 7,
11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97. What is the sum of all circular primes
less than $N$?
*** My Algorithm
A permutation of a number $n$ cannot be greater than the smallest power of 10
that is at least $n$. This is because it maintains the same number of digits, and
such a power of 10 contains one more digit than $n$. This means that a
permutation of $n$ is not more than $10^{\lceil \log_{10} n \rceil}$. And so we
can precompute a list of the primes under $10^{\lceil \log_{10} N_{\text{max}}
\rceil}$, which in our case is $10^6$.

Now we need a way to get all the rotations of a number. To do this, we can turn
the number into a string and repeatedly remove the last character and add it
back to the front, saving the new rotation each time. From here, the problem
just consists of spotting some optimizations. We need not check any primes with
digits 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 8. This is because the last digit of one of their
rotations will be either even or 5, which means they are divisible by 2 or 5 and
so they are not prime. However, we must include the single-digit primes 2 and 5,
which are circular. After computing the rotations of a prime below $N$ that
passes the above tests, we check if all of them are prime; if so, we count the
ones that are below $N$. Our solution has time complexity
$O(N_{\text{max}}\log\log N_{\text{max}})$.

*** Problem Statement
The decimal number $65 = 1001001001_2$ is palindromic in both decimal and
binary. Find the sum of all natural numers less than $N$ which are palindromic
in base 10 and base $K$.
*** My Algorithm
We need two things to solve this problem: a way to convert a number from base 10
to base $K$ and a way to generate palindromes. First, let's think about how
numbers are written in base 10. The first thing we process is the rightmost
digit, which represents the number of times the corresponding power of 10 goes
into the number. And so we must start with the highest power of the base, remove
as many multiples of it as possible, and continue. This procedure has
$\lfloor\log_K n\rfloor$ steps, where $n$ is the decimal number to be converted.
This is because we perform one step for each possible exponent, where the
maximal exponent on $K$ is $\lfloor \log_K n \rfloor$. To generate palindromes
of length at most $n$, we start with all numbers of length at most
$\frac{n}{2}$.

To generate palindromes of even length at most $n$, we take one
of these numbers $p$ and add on the reverse of $p$. For odd-length palindromes,
we do the same thing, but add one of the digits $0,\ldots,9$ in the middle. And
so there are $9\cdot10^{k-1}$ palindromes with $2k$ digits and $9\cdot10^{k}$
palindromes with $2k + 1$ digits. Given $N$, we generate all palindromes with no
more digits than $N$ and keep the ones less than $N$. We test whether each of
these are palindromic in base $K$. We calculate less than
$10^{\frac{\lfloor\log_K n\rfloor}{2}} \le \sqrt{n}$ palindromes and perform
$\lfloor\log_K n\rfloor \le \log_K n$ operations on each of them. Our solution
has time complexity $O(\sqrt{n}\log n)$.

*** Problem Statement
The number 3797 has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it is possible
to continuously remove digits from left to right, and remain prime at each
stage: 3797, 797, 97, 7. Similarly, we can remove digits from right to left:
3797, 379, 37, 3. Find the sum of primes that are truncatable from left to right
and right to left less than $N$.
*** My Algorithm
A prime is greater than all of its truncations. This means that we can use a
modified Sieve of Eratosthenes. Whenever a prime is encountered, we can check if
all its truncations are also prime; we will already have computed whether each
truncation is prime. When a number has not been marked in the sieve, we mark all
of its multiples, like normal. To right-truncate, we can keep performing integer
division by 10. To left-truncate, we first find the largest power of 10 that
divides the prime. Then, we take the prime modulo this power of 10, and
decrement the power of 10 by one, and repeat. We stop either truncation process
when the value returned is not prime. If at the end of both processes, the
remaining value is 0, it means both truncations were completed and the prime is
fully truncatable. In this case, we add the prime to a running count. This
algorithm has time complexity $O(n\log\log n)$.

If $p$ is the perimeter of a right triangle with side lengths $\{a,b,c\}$, then
there are exactly 3 solutions for $p = 120$:
\begin{equation*}
\{20,48,52\}, \{24,45,51\}, \{30,40,50\}
\end{equation*}
For which value of $p \le N$ is the number of solutions maximized? If there are
multiple possible answers, print the minimum one.
*** My Algorithm
A famous method of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple#Proof_of_Euclid's_formula][generating Pythagorean triples]] is due to Euclid:
\begin{equation}
a = m^2 - n^2 \quad b = 2mn \quad c = m^2 + n^2 \quad m > n
\label{generating}
\end{equation}
It is easy to verify that such choices of $a,b,c$ always form a Pythagorean
triple. Furthermore, \eqref{generating} generates all primitive Pythagorean
triples (triples for which $\mathrm{gcd}(a,b,c) = 1$) for coprime $m,n$ of
opposite parity. Every Pythagorean triple can be written as $\{ak,bk,ck\}$,
where $k$ is some natural number and $\{a,b,c\}$ is a primitive Pythagorean
triple. Our strategy is to generate all primitive Pythagorean triples with
perimeter less than $N$. We can take their multiples to get all Pythagorean
triples with perimeter less than $N$. When $m$ or $n$ is 0, the triangle
produced is an isoceles right triangle. Because such a triangle would have a
hypotenuse that is a multiple of $\sqrt{2}$, we know it will not produce a
Pythagorean triple. And so $m,n \le 1$. The perimeter of the triangle is
\begin{equation}
a + b + c = 2m^2 + mn = 2m(m+n).
\label{perimeter}
\end{equation}
We know $n > 0$, so \eqref{perimeter} is at least $2m^2$. This means that we
need not search $m$ for which $2m^2 > N_{\text{max}}$. And so we search $1 \le m
\le \sqrt{\frac{N_{\text{max}}}{2}}$. We also know that $m > n$ (otherwise $a$
would not be a positive length), so we only search $1 \le n < m$.

For each $m,n$, we must check three things. First, we check that the perimeter
$2m(m+n)$ is not more than $N$. Then we check that $m$ and $n$ are coprime
($\mathrm{gcd}(m,n) = 1$). Finally, we must check that $m$ and $n$ have opposite
parity. This means one of them is odd, the other even. So their sum must be odd.
We perform $O(\sqrt{N})$ iterations in each loop for $m$ and $n$. And so we
check each $m,n$ in $O(N)$ time. If we pass all of these tests, then we have a
primitive Pythagorean triple.

We will maintain a list =pythag= for which =pythag[i]= gives the number of solutions
for perimeter $i$. For each primitive Pythagorean triple, we increment each
~pythag[k*P]~, where $P$ is the perimeter of the triple and $1 \le k \le \lfloor
\frac{N_{\text{max}}}{P} \rfloor$. This means we count each primitive triple and
all the multiples derived from it. Because we make a list, we can answer each
query quickly. We maintain a second list =freq= of the indices corresponding to
the strictly right maximal values of =pythag=. That is, for each $i$ in =freq=, we
have =pythag[i]= $>$ =pythag[j]= for each $0 \le j < i$. Because this order is
strict, we only store the lowest solution in cases where there are multiple.
Then, we can binary search ~freq~ for the largest element less than each query.
This is better than slicing =pythag= and using =max=, which is linear in =len(freq)=;
binary search is logarithmic. The list ~freq~ has at most $N$ elements---this is
where each $n < N$ is strictly right maximal. This means we answer each query in
$O(\log N)$ time. And so our solution has time complexity $O(N_{\text{max}} +
T\log N_{\text{max}})$, where $T$ is the number of queries.

*** Problem Statement
An irrational decimal is created by concatenating the positive integers:
\begin{equation*}
0.12345678910\mathbf{1}112131415161718192021\ldots
\end{equation*}
It can be seen that the 12th digit of the fractional part is ~1~. If $d_n$
represents the $n$-th digit of the fractional part, then given integers $i_j$,
find the product of $d_{i_j}$.
*** My Algorithm
We can split up the fractional part into "blocks" where each positive integer
used has the same number of digits. For example, starting at zero, the zeroth
block is =123456789=, the first =101112...9899=, and so on. The numbers used to make
up the $n$-th block (where the first block is $n = 0$) range from $10^n$ to
$10^{n+1} - 1$, inclusive. There are therefore $10^{n+1} - 10^n = 9\cdot10^n$
numbers in the $n$-th block. Because each number in the $n$-th block has $n+1$
digits, the $n$-th block is $9(n+1)10^n$ digits long. We initialize ~block~ at 1.
This means ~block~ is equal to $n+1$. It represents the number of digits in each
integer in the block that $d_i$ is part of. We initialize ~fact~ at 9. It
represents the number of positive integers that make up ~block~. This means
=fact*block= represents the length of =block=. Then, as long as the result is
positive and =fact / block= is less than $9M$, where $M$ is the maximum possible
value of $i$ in $d_i$ (a hard upper bound on the length of the largest block,
given the input constraints), we subtract =fact/block= from the given $d_i$.
Then, we multiply =fact= by 10, representing the ten-fold increase in the number
of elements of the next block, and increment =block= by 1, representing the fact
that we are moving to the next block. The resulting value of ~block~ is the block
in which $d_i$ is located. The resulting value of $d_i$ is =pos+1=, where =pos=
is the zero-indexed "position" of $d_i$ in its block; that is, $d_i$ is the
=pos=-th digit in its block. Because $d_i$ is in the block given by =block=, the
first number in its block is =10//(block-1)=. Each number in this block has ~block~
digits. And so ~pos//block~ gives the number of positive integers that precede the
integer $d_i$ is part of in its block. This means $d_i$ is part of the positive
integer ~10//(block-1) + pos//block~ The leftover after this division (that is,
~pos % block~) is the index (starting at 0) of $d_i$ in the number it is part of.
Because we know the number that $d_i$ is part of, we have solved the problem.
Using our general procedure, we find $d_{i_{j}}$ and calculate their product.
The most intensive part of our solution is finding the block that $d_i$ is part
of; finding the value of $d_i$ after this is just an $O(1)$ string operation.
The lengths of the blocks form an arithmetogeometric sequence, so there are
$O(\log n)$ blocks (not a tight upper bound). And so our solution has time
complexity $O(D\log i_{j_{\text{max}}})$, where $D$ is the number of digits to
find.

*** Problem Statement
We shall say that an $n$-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the
digits 1 to $n$ exactly once. For example, 2143 is a 4-digit pandigital and is
also prime. What is the largest pandigital prime less than or equal to $N$? If
there is none, return $-1$.
*** My Algorithm
The sum of digits of an $n$-digit number is the sum of the first $n$ positive
integers, or $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. Consider the value of this expression modulo 3.
The multiplicative modular inverse of 2 modulo 3 is 2, because $2 \cdot 2 = 4
\equiv 1 \pmod{3}$. And so
\begin{equation}
\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \equiv 2n(n+1) \pmod{3}.
\end{equation}
If and only if 3 divides one of $n$ and $n+1$, then this expression is congruent
to 0 modulo 3; thus it is not prime. This means that $n \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$; and
so if an $n$-digit pandigital prime exists, we must have $n \inn{4,7}$.

This observation really reduces the search space of this problem. Our strategy
is to generate pandigital numbers and check if they are prime. The maximum
possible value of a seven-digit number is $10^8 - 1$; to test the primality of
all such numbers, we need a list of primes up to $\lfloor\sqrt{10^7- 1}\rfloor =
3162$. To generate the pandigital numbers of length 4 and 7, we will take the
first 4 or 7 characters of the string =123456789= and use =itertools.permutations=.
Then, we will check whether each pandigital number $p$ is prime; if so, it is
either part of our list of primes or it is not divisible by any prime less than
or equal to $\sqrt{p}$. Finally, we can answer each query with a binary search
on our list of pandigital primes. As shown above, we generate the primes up to
3162 with a Sieve of Eratosthenes. We then generate the $4! + 7! = 5064$
pandigital candidates. Then, for each of them, we test at most about
$\frac{3162}{\log 3162}$ primes. Finally, we perform a binary search on our list
of pandigital primes with at most $\log 3162$ operations. All in all, the time
complexity for this solution does not depend on the size of $N$, and so it is
$O(1)$; however, the constant term is quite large.

Let us suppose we have some number $t = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. Then
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
2t &= n(n+1) \\
2t &= n^2 + n \\
n^2 + n - 2t &= 0 \\
n &= \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{8t + 1}}{2}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Because we are solving for positive $n$, we have
\begin{equation}
n = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{8t + 1}}{2}.
\label{n}
\end{equation}
We know that $t$ is a triangle number if and only if \eqref{n} is an integer. To
compute the name scores, we use the same method as in [[../22/][Project Euler 22]]. To finish the
problem, we read in the names, and count them if their score is a triangle
number. The time complexity of this solution is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number

2P_n &= 3n^2 - n \\
n &= \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4\cdot3\cdot2P_n}}{6}.

is an integer. From here we use a brute force approach. For each $K < n < N$,
test whether one of $P_n \pm P_{n-k}$ is pentagonal. This solution has time

up, we only proceed with $n$ if $n$ and $Kn$ contain the same number of digits.
A further optimization is to check that each digit of $n$ is unique.

*** Problem Statement
How many, not necessarily distinct, values of $\binom{n}{r}$, for $n \le N$, are
greater than $K$?
*** My Algorithm
A brute-force search is too slow. And so we exploit the symmetry of Pascal's
triangle, which contains the binomial coefficients. Because $\binom{n}{k} =
\binom{n}{n-k}$, we need only check up to $\frac{n}{2}$. Furthermore, if
$\binom{n}{k}$ is the first value greater than $K$, then because the entries of
Pascal's triangle strictly increase until the central term, all the entries
between $k$ and $n-k$, inclusive, will be greater than $K$. This amounts to
$n-2k+1$. We also make use of the recurrence relation
\begin{equation}
\binom{a}{b+1} = \binom{a}{b}\frac{a-b}{b+1},
\end{equation}
as described in my solution to [[../15/][Project Euler 15]]. We iterate through the binomial
coefficients in row $n$ until we find one greater than $K$, say $\binom{n}{i}$.
Then the answer is the sum of $n + 1 - 2i$ for each $n \le N$. This solution has
time complexity $O(N^2)$ (this is really not a tight bound).

*** Problem Statement
If we take 47, reverse it, and add, we get $47 + 74 = 121$, which is a
palindrome. Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example,
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
349 + 943 &= 1292, \\
1292 + 2921 &= 4213, \\
4213 + 3124 &= 7337.
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
That is, 349 takes 3 iterations to arrive at a palindrome. Although no one has
proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers, like 196, never produce a
palindrome. A number that never forms a palindrome through the reverse and add
process is called a Lychrel number. Due to the theoretical nature of these
numbers, and for the purpose of this problem, we shall assume that a number is
Lychrel until proven otherwise. In addition, you are given that for every number
below 10000, it will either become a palindrome in less than fifty iterations,
or, no one, with all the computing power that exists, has managed so far to map
it to a palindrome. Many numbers converge to the same palindrome; for example,
\begin{equation*}
19,28,29,37,38,46,47,56,64,65,73,74,82,83,91,92,110,121
\end{equation*}
all converge to 121, a total of 18 numbers. Given $N$, find the palindrome to
which the most numbers from 1 to $N$, inclusive, converge.
*** My Algorithm
To check whether a number is a palindrome, we use string comprehension. We
maintain a frequency dictionary that maps a palindrome to the count of numbers
that converge to it. For each $n \le N$, we apply up to 60 iterations of the
reverse-add process. If at any point we get a palindrome, we break and add it to
the frequency table. Otherwise, we increment the count corresponding to 0. To
remove the numbers which did not yield a palindrome in 60 iterations, we set
~freq[0] = 0~. Finally, we sort the frequency table and get the palindrome with
the highest associated count. For each $n$, we perform at most 60 iterations,
and so this solution has time complexity $O(N)$.

It is possible to show that $\sqrt{2}$ has the following infinite continued
fraction expansion:
\begin{equation*}
\sqrt{2} = 1 + \frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{2 + \frac{1}{2 + \cdots}}}
\end{equation*}
By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get the convergents of
$\sqrt{2}$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
1 + \frac{1}{2} &= \frac{3}{2} \\
1 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{1}{2}} &= \frac{7}{5} \\
1 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{1}{2}}} &= \frac{17}{12} \\
1 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{1}{2}}}} &= \frac{41}{29}.
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
The next three convergents are $\frac{99}{70},\frac{239}{169}$, and
$\frac{577}{408}$. However, the eighth convergent, $\frac{1393}{985}$, is the
first for which the number of digits in the numerator exceeds the number of
digits in the denominator. Print the convergent numbers $n \le N$ where this
happens.
*** My Algorithm
A common piece of notation for a continued fraction
\begin{equation}
a_0 + \frac{1}{a_1 + \frac{1}{a_2 + \cdots}}
\end{equation}
is $[a_0;a_1,a_2,\ldots]$. Because all the coefficients $a_i, i > 1$ in our case
are 2, the continued fraction expansion for $\sqrt{2}$ is self-similar. In
particular, if one convergent is $\frac{p}{q}$, we can write the next as
\begin{equation}
1 + \frac{1}{1+\frac{p}{q}} = 1 + \frac{q}{p+q} = \frac{p+2q}{p+q}.
\end{equation}
Using this recurrence relation, we can easily compute the convergents and count
which ones have a numerator with more digits than the denominator. This solution
has time complexity $O(N)$.

It is interesting to note that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both

complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side
length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the side length
of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first
falls below $N\%$?

As shown in my solution to [[../28/), the corners of a number spiral of size $n$ are of the form $n^2 - i(n-1][Project Euler 28]]$, for $i \in \{1,2,3,4\}$. We
discount the case where $i = 4$, because this is $(n+2)^2$. We use the
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test][Miller-Rabin primality test]] to search such numbers and count the primes until
the desired ratio is reached. This solution has time complexity $O(N\log^3N)$,
where $N$ is the maximum side length we must search.

The five-digit number $16807 = 7^5$ is also a fifth power. Given $N$, find the

*** My Algorithm
An $n$-digit $n$-th power has $n$-th root at most 9, because $10^n$ is an
$(n+1)$-digit number. If $a^n$ is an $n$-digit number, then unless $a = 9$, we
also have that $(a+1)^n$ is an $n$-digit number. We must find the lowest $a$
such that $a^n$ has $n$ digits. We have
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
10^{n-1} &\le a^n < 10^{n} \\
10^{1-\frac{1}{n}} &\le a < 10 \\
a &= \lceil10^{1-\frac{1}{n}}\rceil.
\end{split}

And so $k^n$ is an $n$-digit number for all $k \in

*** Problem Statement
The constant $e$ can be written as the infinite continued fraction
$[2;1,2,1,\,1,4,1,\,1,6,1,\ldots,1,2k,\ldots]$. Find the sum of the digits in
the $N$-th convergent of the continued fraction expansion for $e$.
*** A Recurrence Relation
We will show the following theorem. Let the the $n$-th convergent of a continued
fraction $[a_0;a_1,a_2,\ldots]$ be $\frac{P_n}{Q_n}$. Then the $(n+1)$-th
convergent is
\begin{equation}
\frac{a_{n+1}P_n + P_{n-1}}{a_{n+1}Q_{n} + Q_{n-1}}.
\end{equation}
We use induction. Because the 0-th convergent is $a_0$, we define $P_0 = a_0,
Q_0 = 1$. Then the first convergent is
\begin{equation}
a_0 + \frac{1}{a_1} = \frac{a_0a_1 + 1}{a_1},
\end{equation}
so $P_1 = a_0a_1 + 1, Q_1 = a_1$. As a base case, we show that the formula holds
for $n = 2$:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
a_0 + \frac{1}{a_1 + \frac{1}{a_2}} &= a_0 + \frac{a_2}{a_1a_2 + 1} \\
&= \frac{a_0a_1a_2 + a_0 + a_2}{a_1a_2 + 1} \\
&= \frac{a_2(a_0a_1 + 1) + a_0}{a_2a_1 + 1} \\
&= \frac{a_2P_1 + P_0}{a_2Q_1 + Q_0}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Now suppose inductively that
\begin{equation}
P_{n} = a_{n}P_{n-1} + P_{n-2}, Q_{n} = a_nQ_{n-1} + Q_{n-2}.
\end{equation}
The $n$-th convergent is
\begin{equation}
\frac{P_n}{Q_n} = a_1 + \cfrac{1}{a_2 + \cfrac{1}{\begin{array}{ccc}a_{3} + & & \\ & \ddots & \\ & & + \cfrac{1}{a_{n-1} + \cfrac{1}{a_{n}}}\end{array}}}
\label{n-conv}
\end{equation}
Turning \eqref{n-conv} into the $(n+1)$-th convergent involves replacing $a_n$
with $a_n + \frac{1}{a_{n+1}}$. Using the recursive formula, this gives
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{P_{n+1}}{Q_{n+1}} &= \frac{\frac{P_{n-1}}{a_{n+1}} + a_nP_{n-1} + P_{n-2}}{\frac{Q_{n-1}}{a_{n+1}} + a_nQ_{n-1} + Q_{n-2}} \\
&= \frac{\frac{P_{n-1}}{a_{n+1}} + P_n}{\frac{Q_{n-1}}{a_{n+1}} + Q_n} \\
&= \frac{a_{n+1}P_n + P_{n-1}}{a_{n+1}Q_{n} + Q_{n-1}},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
which proves the theorem.
*** My Algorithm
Let the $n$-th coefficient in the continued fraction expansion for $e$ be $a_n$.
Then $a_0 = 2$. From then on, $a_1 = a_3 = 1$, and $a_2 = 2$. In particular,
$a_n = 1$ if $n$ is congruent to 0 or 1 mod 3 (unless $n = 0$). And so
\begin{equation}
a_n =
\begin{cases}
2 &n = 0, \\
2\left(\lfloor\frac{n}{3}\rfloor + 1\right) &n \equiv 2 \pmod 3, \\
1 &\text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
Using this and our theorem, we iteratively calculate the numerator of the $N$-th
convergent by
\begin{equation}
P_n = a_nP_{n-1} + P_{n-2}.
\end{equation}
We cache the previous two convergents at each step. Finally, we take the digit
sum. Our solution has time complexity $O(N)$.

Given $N$, find the smallest value $n<N$ such that $\frac{n}{\varphi(n)}$ achieves

*** My Algorithm
We use Euler's product formula for the totient function,
\begin{equation}
\varphi(n) = n\prod\limits_{p|n}\left(1 - \frac{1}{p}\right),

taken over the distinct primes dividing $n$. This formula gives
\begin{equation}
\frac{n}{\varphi(n)} = \frac{1}{\prod\limits_{p|n}\left(1 - \frac{1}{p}\right)}.
\end{equation}
Therefore, to maximize $\frac{n}{\varphi(n)}$, we must minimize the product.
This is done when $n$ is a product of many distinct primes. We want as many of
these primes as possible to be small, so that their reciprocals are big. And so
$n$ should be the product of the first $k$ primes, for some $k$. That is, $n$ is
the $k$-th [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primorial][primorial number]]. The first primorial number greater than $10^18$ is
the product of the primes up to 41. Our solution consists of multiplying primes
until the given upper bound is reached. Because the $n$-th primorial has size
about $e^n$, our solution is $O(\log n)$.

*** Problem Statement
The fraction $\frac{a}{b}$ is called a reduced proper fraction if $a$ and $b$
are positive integers with $a < b$ and $\mathrm{gcd}(a,b) = 1$. If we list the
reduced proper fractions for $b \le 8$ in increasing order, we get
\begin{equation*}
\frac18, \frac17, \frac16, \frac15, \frac14, \frac27, \frac13, \frac38, \frac25, \frac37, \frac12, \frac47, \frac35, \frac58, \frac23, \frac57, \frac34, \frac45, \frac56, \frac67, \frac78
\end{equation*}
It can be seen that $\frac25$ is the fraction immediately to the left of
$\frac37$. By listing the set of reduced proper fractions with denominator at
most $N$ in increasing order, find the numerator and denominator of the fraction
immediately to the left of $\frac{a}{b}$.
*** My Algorithm
Let the sequence of reduced proper fractions with denominator at most $n$ listed
in increasing order be the $n$-th [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farey_sequence][Farey sequence]], $F_n$. We will show that if
$\frac{c}{d}$ directly precedes $\frac{a}{b}$ in $F_n$, then $ad - bc = 1$.
Because $\mathrm{gcd}(a,b) = 1$, the equation
\begin{equation}
ay - bx = 1
\label{dioph}
\end{equation}
has infinitely many integer solutions, by Bezout's theorem. In particular, if
$(x_0,y_0)$ is a solution, so is $(x_0 + ak, y_0 + bk)$. Let us choose $k$ such
that $n - b < y_0 + br \le n$. And so there exists a solution $(x,y)$ such that
\begin{equation}
0 \le n - b < y \le n.
\label{fundineq}
\end{equation}
Suppose $\mathrm{gcd}(x,y) = d$. Because $d|x,d|y$, we have $d|(ay - bx)$, and
so $d | 1$. This implies that $x$ and $y$ are coprime. Because of this and the
fact that $y \le n$, we have $\frac{x}{y} \in F_n$. Furthermore,
\begin{equation}
\frac{a}{b} > \frac{a}{b} - \frac{1}{by} = \frac{ay - 1}{by} = \frac{bx}{by} = \frac{x}{y}.
\end{equation}
And so $\frac{x}{y}$ precedes $\frac{a}{b}$. Suppose $(x,y) \neq (c,d)$. Then
$\frac{x}{y}$ precedes $\frac{c}{d}$, and
\begin{equation}
\frac{c}{d} - \frac{x}{y} = \frac{cy - dx}{dy} \ge \frac{1}{dy}.
\label{ineq1}
\end{equation}
On the other hand,
\begin{equation}
\frac{a}{b} - \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad - bc}{bd} \ge \frac{1}{bd}.
\label{ineq2}
\end{equation}
Applying \eqref{dioph} gives
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{xy} = \frac{ay - bx}{by} = \frac{a}{b} - \frac{x}{y}.
\label{step1}
\end{equation}
Applying the sum of \eqref{ineq1} and \eqref{ineq2} to \eqref{step1} gives
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{a}{b} - \frac{x}{y} &\ge \frac{1}{dy} + \frac{1}{bd} \\
&= \frac{b+y}{bdy}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
By \eqref{fundineq} and the above, we thus have $\frac{1}{by} > \frac{n}{bdy}$.
Because $d < n$, we obtain the contradiction $\frac{1}{by} > \frac{1}{by}$. Thus
$(x,y) = (c,d)$. This proves the result that $ad - bc = 1$.

Given $a,b$, we must solve for $ad - bc = 1$ such that $d$, the denominator, is
maximized. We can do this using the extended Euclidean algorithm. Suppose $k$ is
the multiplicative inverse of $a$ modulo $b$. Then $ak \equiv 1 \pmod b$. This
means $ak - bj = 1$, for some positive integer $j$. We wish to maximize $k$.
Given that $(k,j)$ is a solution, so is $(k+nb,j+na)$. Thus we set
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
k + nb &\le N \\
n &\le \frac{N-k}{b} \\
n &= \left\lfloor \frac{N-k}{b} \right\rfloor.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Solving for $j$, we get $j = \frac{a\left\lfloor \frac{N-k}{b} \right\rfloor +
 ak - 1}{b}$. solution is
\begin{equation}
(c,d) = \left(\left\lfloor \frac{ab\left\lfloor \frac{N-k}{b} \right\rfloor + ak - 1}{b} \right\rfloor, b\left\lfloor \frac{N-k}{b} \right\rfloor + k \right).
\end{equation}
The only expensive part of this procedure is calculating the modular inverse,
and so our solution has $O(\log b)$ time complexity.

The fraction $\frac{a}{b}$ is called a reduced proper fraction if $a$ and $b$

\end{equation*}
How many elements are contained in the set of reduced proper fractions with
denominator at most $N$?
*** My Algorithm
In order for a fraction to be in reduced form, the numerator and denominator
must be coprime. And so there are $\varphi(n)$ fractions with denominator $n$.
This is true for all $n$ except for 1, which does not contribute any fractions,
because we only consider the elements of $\mathbb{Q} \cap (0,1)$. In total,
there are
\begin{equation}
\sum\limits_{n=1}^N \varphi(n) - 1
\end{equation}
fractions. We use Euler's product formula for the totient function:
\begin{equation}
\varphi(n) = \prod\limits_{p|n}\left(1 - \frac{1}{p}\right).
\end{equation}
We can calculate this by using successive subtractions, starting from $n$. For
example, the primes that divide 15 are 3 and 5. This gives $15 - \frac{15}{3} =
10 \to 10 - \frac{10}{5} = 8 = \phi(n)$. We initialize an array =phi= of $n$
0-entries. This accounts for $\varphi(1)$, which we do not wish to include in
our final count.

Then, we use a method similar to the Sieve of Eratosthenes. If =phi[n] = 0=, we
have not yet dealt with $n$ and its multiples. Because $n$ is prime, we set
=phi[n] = n - 1=. For all other multiples $kn < N$, we account for $n$ being a
prime factor by setting =phi[k/n] = phi[k/n]//n=. Then, we sum the entries of ~phi~,
and add 1. To give our final answer, we sum ~phi[n]~ for all $n < N$. Doing this
once for each test case would have time complexity $O(Tn\log\log n)$. There are
too many test cases for this, so we create a prefix sum array. And so our
solution has time complexity $O(n\log\log n + T)$, where $T$ is the number of
test cases.

subtract 1 to exclude the vacuous sum which is just $N$ itself, and then we
report our answer modulo $P$. Our solution has time complexity $O(N^2 + T)$.

*** Problem Statement
It is possible to write 10 as the sum of primes in exactly 5 different ways:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
10 &= 7+3 \\
&= 5+5 \\
&= 5+3+2 \\
&= 2+2+1 \\
&= 3+3+2+2 \\
&= 2+2+2+2+2
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
How many ways can $N$ be written as the sum of primes?
*** My Algorithm
Please see my solution to [[../31/][Project Euler 31]], as we use the same dynamic
programming techniques. This problem is a variant on the coin sum problem in
Euler 31. Here the coins take on the values of the primes up to $N$. There are
about $\frac{N}{\log N}$ primes up to $N$. Our solution has time complexity
$O(\frac{N^2}{\log N} + T)$.

*** Problem Statement
Let $p(n)$ represent the number of ways $n$ can be written as the sum of
positive integers. For example, $p(5) = 7$. Given $N$, return $p(N)$ modulo
$10^9 + 7$.
*** My Algorithm
We cannot use the $O(n^2)$ technique given in [[../31/][Project Euler 31]]. Instead, we will
make use of a wonderful piece of mathematics known as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagonal_number_theorem][Euler's pentagonal number
theorem]]. It states that
\begin{equation}
\prod_{k=1}^\infty (1-x^k) = \sum_{i \in \mathbb{Z}}(-1)^ix^{g_i},
\end{equation}
where $g_i$ is the $i$-th generalized pentagonal number, given by $g_n =
\frac{n(3n-1)}{2}$ for $n = \pm1,\pm2,\pm3,\ldots$ (note that $n$ is positive
then negative and so on). In other words,
\begin{equation}
(1-x)(1-x^2)(1-x^3) \cdots = 1 - x - x^2 + x^5 + x^7 - x^12 - x^15 + x^22 + \cdots
\end{equation}
To prove this, let's first define the series $A_n$ as
\begin{equation}
A_n = 1 - x^{2n - 1} - \sum_{i=3}^\infty x^{in - 1} \prod_{j = 0}^{i-3} (1 - x^{n+j}).
\end{equation}
Factoring out an $x^{3n-1}$ term from the last summand gives
\begin{equation}
A_n = 1 - x^{2n - 1} - x^{3n-1}\sum_{i=0}^\infty x^{in} \prod_{j = 0}^{i} (1 - x^{n+j}).
\end{equation}
Let us denote this new series as $B_n$, such that
\begin{equation}
A_n = 1 - x^{2n - 1} - x^{3n-1}B_n.
\end{equation}
Pulling out the $i=j=0$ term from the series $B_n$ gives
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
B_n &= \sum_{i=0}^\infty x^{in} \prod_{j = 0}^{i} (1 - x^{n+j}) \\
&= x^0(1 - x^{n+0}) + \sum_{i=1}^\infty x^{in} (1-x^n)\prod_{j = 0}^{i} (1 - x^{n+j}) \\
&= 1 - x^n + \sum_{i=1}^\infty x^{in} (1-x^n)\prod_{j = 1}^{i} (1 - x^{n+j}).
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Distributing the $j = 0$ term we pulled out of the product, we have
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
B_n &= 1 - x^n + \sum_{i=1}^\infty x^{in}\prod_{j = 1}^{i} (1 - x^{n+j}) - \sum_{i=1}^\infty x^nx^{in}\prod_{j = 1}^{i} (1 - x^{n+j}) \\
B_n &= 1 - x^n + \sum_{i=1}^\infty x^{in}\prod_{j = 1}^{i} (1 - x^{n+j}) - \sum_{i=1}^\infty x^{(i+1)n}\prod_{j = 1}^{i} (1 - x^{n+j}) \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}

It implies that
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
p(n) &= \sum_k (-1)^{k-1}p(n-g_k) \\
&= p(n-1) + p(n-2) - p(n-5) - p(n-7) + \cdots,
\end{split}
\end{equation}

First, let's look at the generating function for $p(n)$. We have
\begin{equation}
\prod_{k=1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{1-x^k} \right) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty p(k)x^k.
\end{equation}
To see why this is the case, let's expand each term of the product as a
geometric series. It will have first term 1 and common ratio $x^k$. We then have
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\prod_{k=1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{1-x^k} \right) &= (1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \cdots)(1 + x^2 + x^4 + x^6 + \cdots)(1 + x^3 + x^6 + x^9 + \cdots)\cdots \\
&= \prod_{k=1}^\infty \left( \sum_{j=0}^\infty x^{kj} \right).
\end{split}
\label{part-form}
\end{equation}
Consider the coefficient on the term $x^n$. To get $x^n$, we take one summand
from each term in the sum. In other words, each term is of the form $x^{k_1 +
2k_2 + 3k_3 + \cdots}$. A combinatorial interpretation is that each coefficient
$k_i$ represents the number of times $i$ appears in a particular way of writing
$n$ as a sum of natural numbers. This means that the coefficient on $x^n$ is the
number of such ways to write $n$, which is $p(n)$.
