** Voraciously curious. Ceaselessly skeptical. Unabashedly nerdy.
If any of these terms describe you, then great!
You're in the right place.
I'm Gautam.
Welcome to my personal website.
You can find my many curious, skeptical, and nerdy thoughts on my [[/blog/][blog]].

I love mathematics, and I learn computer science and chemistry on the side.
I firmly believe in the power of ideas.
Interesting ideas come from all walks of life: academic subjects, learning a new language, meeting new people, or idle musings over a good cup of tea.
Such ideas give my life colour and promise to occupy me for a lifetime.
** A good problem is never solved.
The most fulfilling problems lead not just to answers that satisfy inquiry but to questions that further it.
After all, what is an interesting idea without a question to inspire it?
Questions are the ultimate companion to a lifelong learner (non-human, of course).
They motivate me to rejoice in spite of failure and work hard in spite of success.
The path paved by interesting questions never ends---and that's what's so exciting about it!
** Here's some more about me.
I'm a Grade 11 student at the [[https://utschools.ca][University of Toronto Schools (UTS)]].
My favourite number is 7, but perhaps it should be $n$: why consider one when you can consider them all?
My favourite anime series in Steins;Gate, and my favourite infinite series is Fourier; it seems I like time.
Speaking of time, when I have some lying around, I like to practice my handwriting and calligraphy, play table tennis, and watch basketball.

*** Comparing $e^\pi$ and $\pi^e$                            :calculus:proof:

:EXPORT_DESCRIPTION: "Which is greater: e^pi or pi^e? I solve this puzzle with differentiation, Taylor series, concavity, and the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality."
:END:
The constants $e$ and $\pi$ are everywhere in mathematics.
Determining the greater of the two expressions $e^\pi$ and $\pi^e$ (without using a calculator, of course...) is a fun puzzle that you can approach in many ways.
I'd like to discuss my solutions.
**** Differentiation
We shall perform the same operations on the two expressions.
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        e^{\pi} &\odot \pi^e \\
        e^{\frac{\pi}{e}} &\odot \pi^{\frac{e}{e}} \\
        e^{\frac{1}{e}} &\odot \pi^{\frac{1}{\pi}}
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
To show that $e^\pi > \pi^e$, it suffices to show that $e^{\frac{1}{e}} > \pi^{\frac{1}{\pi}}$.
Let $y = x^{\frac{1}{x}}$.
Then we can implicitly differentiate to find the critical points.
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		\ln{y} &= \ln{x^{\frac{1}{x}}} \\
		\ln{y} &= \frac{\ln{x}}{x} \\
		\diff{}{x}\ln{y} &= \diff{}{x}\frac{\ln{x}}{x} \\
		\frac{1}{y}y' &= \frac{x\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) - \ln{x}\cdot1}{x^2} \\
		y' &= x^{\frac{1}{x}}\frac{1 - \ln{x}}{x^2}.
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
The expressions $x^{\frac{1}{x}}$ and $x^2$ are always positive, so there is only critical point: when $1 - \ln{x} = 0$, or when $x = e$.
We must find whether this point is a global minimum or a maximum.
When $x = 1 < e$, we have $1 - \ln{x} = 1$, so the function is increasing.
The value $x = e^2 > e$ gives $1 - \ln{x} = -1$, which means the function is decreasing.
Thus $x^{\frac{1}{x}}$ has a global maximum at $x = e$.
And so $e^{\frac{1}{e}} > \pi^{\frac{1}{\pi}}$, which shows that $e^\pi > \pi^e$.
**** Inequality
If we use the inequality $1 + x < e^x$ (I will present three proofs of this below), then a very simple solution presents itself.
The equality holds for all $x$, but we only require it to hold for positive $x$.
Make the substitution $x = \frac{\pi}{e} - 1$, in an effort to cancel out the 1 on the right side of the inequality and introduce $\pi$.
Because $\pi > e$, $\frac{\pi}{e} - 1 > 0$, and so
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        1 + \frac{\pi}{e} - 1 &< e^{\frac{\pi}{e} - 1} \\
	    \pi\cdot\frac{1}{e} &< e^{\frac{\pi}{e}} \cdot \frac{1}{e} \\
		\pi &< e^{\frac{\pi}{e}}\\
		\pi^e &< e^\pi.
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
Wonderful, isn't it?
***** Taylor Series
This is the most standard proof I have; I think it's the least exciting.
We only prove the equality for positive $x$.
We know
\begin{equation}
e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots
\end{equation}
Thus for $x > 0$, all the terms on the right side will be positive, and so $e^x > 1 + x$.
***** Concavity
This method requires a little more "geometric intuition" than the last.
At $x = 0$, we have $e^x = 1$.
At this point $(0,1)$, the tangent line to $e^x$ has slope $1$ and has the equation $y = 1 + x$.
Because $(e^x)'' = e^x > 0$, $e^x$ is always concave up, so it is always above its tangent line.
Therefore, $1 + x < e^x$.
***** AM-GM
This is my favourite proof.
It's a little less intuitive than the others, but I think it's beautiful.
We use the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality.
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
	     \sqrt[n]{1+x} &= \sqrt[n]{\smash[b]{\underbrace{1\cdot1\cdots1}_{\text{$n-1$ times}}\cdot(1+x)}} \\\\[1em]
	     &\le \frac{\overbrace{1+\dotsb+1}^{\text{$n-1$ times}}+(1+x)}{n} \\
	     &= \frac{\overbrace{1+\dotsb+1}^{\text{$n$ times}}+x}{n} \\
	    &= 1 + \frac{x}{n}.
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
Strict equality in the AM-GM inequality only holds when all the terms are equal.
In this case, $x > 0$, so $1 + x \neq 1$, so we have strict inequality.
This gives $\sqrt[n]{1+x} < 1 + \frac{x}{n}$.
Raising both sides to the $n$-th power gives
\begin{equation}
    1 + x < \left(1 + \frac{x}{n}\right)^n.
\end{equation}
Taking the limit as $n$ approaches $\infty$ on both sides yields
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \lim_{n\to\infty} (1 + x) &< \lim_{n\to\infty} \left(1 + \frac{x}{n}\right)^n \\
        1 + x &< e^x.
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
Using the limit definition of $e$, we conclude our proof.

I get the feeling that there are many other ways to attack this problem.
If you can solve it with a method that I have not shown, please let me know!

:END:
**** Problem Statement
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9.
The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below $n$.
**** My Algorithm
For the Project Euler problem, $n = 1000$.

In general, the sum of the natural numbers up to $n$ is the $n$-th [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number][triangular number]].
Let's call this $T(n)$.
A well known formula for this is
\begin{equation}
	T(n) = \sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}.
	\label{triangular-num}
\end{equation}

The sum of all multiples of 3 below $n$ looks like this:
\begin{equation}
	1\cdot3 + 2\cdot 3 + 3 \cdot 3 + \ldots + \floor{\frac{n-1}{3}} \cdot 3.
	\label{3-list}
\end{equation}
We can factor 3 out and write \eqref{3-list} as $3T\floor{\frac{n-1}{3}}$, which we know how to find with \eqref{triangular-num}.
We can do the same thing with 5.

But now we've overcounted!
Each multiple of 15 under $n$ has been counted twice: once as a multiple of 3, then again as a multiple of 5.
We can fix this by subtracting the sum of all multiples of 15 under $n$.
And so our desired answer is
\begin{equation}
	3T\floor{\frac{n-1}{3}} + 5T\floor{\frac{n-1}{5}} - 15T\floor{\frac{n-1}{15}}.
\end{equation}
The complexity of this solution is $O(1)$, because our answer is just a computation.

## Other Solutions

A brute-force solution that adds each number $i$ from 1 to $n-1$ to a count if $i$ is divisible by 3 *or* 5 would have time complexity $O(n)$.
With the large input sizes of the Hackerrank problem ($n \le 10^9$) this solution is too slow, but it easily passes the original Project Euler problem.
