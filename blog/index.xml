      <title>Prime Reciprocals Diverge!</title>

      <description>Introduction In this post, we will investigate the infinite series
\begin{equation} \sum_{p} \frac{1}{p}, \end{equation}
taken over all primes \(p\). In particular, we will show that this series diverges.
Calculus and the Prime Number Theorem First, we&amp;rsquo;ll show that this problem falls to the incredible might of the following inequalty, which bounds the value of the $n$-th prime:
\begin{equation} n\log n - n \log\log n \le p_n \le n\log n + n\log\log n \quad (n &amp;gt; 5) \end{equation}</description>

      <title>Relatively Prime, Relatively Often</title>

      <description>Say you choose two integers. What&amp;rsquo;s the chance that they&amp;rsquo;re coprime? My intuition says that it can&amp;rsquo;t be more than one-half, because half of all numbers share a factor of 2. But I&amp;rsquo;m thoroughly wrong here. The probability is actually \(\frac{6}{\pi^2}\), which is about \(61\%\).
We wish to find the probability that two randomly selected integers \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime. If this is true, then \(\mathrm{gcd}(m,n) = 1\). Let&amp;rsquo;s say that \(p = \mathrm{P}(\mathrm{gcd}(m,n)=1)\).</description>

      <title>Almost There I</title>

      <description>Mathematics students are often told not to carelessly extrapolate small sample sizes into general claims. Indeed, this is a general truth of life: isolated examples do not constitute general proof. Say you wanted to convince me of a fact about numbers. You could show me that your fact was true for all numbers up to ten, a hundred, a million, or to whatever ridiculously huge number you could think of&amp;mdash;but it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t constitute a mathematical proof.</description>

      <title>Inspheres and Circumspheres of Simplices</title>

      <description>Every triangle can be circumscribed by a circle, because a circle can always be drawn through three given points, so long as they are not colinear. In fact, every triangle also has a circle that is inscribed in it. These two circles are called the triangle&amp;rsquo;s circumcircle and incircle. Finding these circles for a triangle is simple if the triangle is equilateral, a bit harder if it is right-angled, and a bit harder still if it is not.</description>

      <title>On the Ball in $n$ Euclidean Dimensions</title>

      <description>One of my favourite formulas in mathematics is the one for the area of a circle, \(\pi r^2\). Its simplicity intrigued my young mind; the circle is, in a sense, the simplest, the roundest shape, and this formula seems to encapsulate the circle&amp;rsquo;s aura of &amp;ldquo;completion.&amp;rdquo; As I grew older, I learned more such formulas for the volumes and surface areas of familiar geometric objects. In particular, I learned of the formula for the volume of a sphere \(\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\).</description>

      <title>Harmonic Numbers and Binomial Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://gautammanohar.com/harmonic-numbers-and-binomial-coefficients/</link>

      <description>The $n$-th harmonic number is defined as the sum of reciprocals of the first \(n\) natural numbers:
\begin{equation} \sum\limits_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k}. \end{equation}
We wish to prove the following identity involving harmonic numbers and binomial coefficients:
\begin{equation} \sum\limits_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k} = -\sum\limits_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k}\binom{n}{k}(-1)^k. \label{identity} \end{equation}
I have two solutions: one with calculus, and one by induction.
Calculus First, we notice that
\begin{equation} \int_0^1 x^{k-1} \d x = \frac{x^k}{k} \Biggr\rvert_0^1 = \frac{1}{k} - \frac{0}{k} = \frac{1}{k}.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Heron&#39;s Formula</title>
      <link>https://gautammanohar.com/generalizing-herons-formula/</link>

      <description>A well-known fact in Euclidean geometry is the following expression for the area of a triangle given its side lengths:
\begin{equation} A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}, \end{equation}
where \(s\) is the semiperimeter of the triangle, \(\frac{a+b+c}{2}\). Our goal is to generalize this formula to quadrilaterals. Just like in proofs of Heron&amp;rsquo;s formula that use trigonometry, we will use the formula for the area of a triangle
\begin{equation} A = \frac{1}{2}ab\sin C \end{equation}</description>

      <title>Comparing $e^\pi$ and $\pi^e$</title>
      <link>https://gautammanohar.com/comparing-e%5Cpi-and-%5Cpie/</link>

      <description>The constants \(e\) and \(\pi\) are everywhere in mathematics. Determining the greater of the two expressions \(e^\pi\) and \(\pi^e\) (without using a calculator, of course&amp;hellip;) is a fun puzzle that you can approach in many ways. I&amp;rsquo;d like to discuss my solutions.
Differentiation We shall perform the same operations on the two expressions.
\begin{equation} \begin{split} e^{\pi} &amp;amp;\odot \pi^e \\
e^{\frac{\pi}{e}} &amp;amp;\odot \pi^{\frac{e}{e}} \\
e^{\frac{1}{e}} &amp;amp;\odot \pi^{\frac{1}{\pi}} \end{split} \end{equation}
To show that \(e^\pi &amp;gt; \pi^e\), it suffices to show that \(e^{\frac{1}{e}} &amp;gt; \pi^{\frac{1}{\pi}}\).</description>
