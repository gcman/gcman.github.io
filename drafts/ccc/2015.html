      <p>This is part of a <a href="../">project</a> to provide unofficial solutions for part C of the <a href="http://www.cheminst.ca/outreach/canadian-chemistry-contest">Canadian Chemistry Contest</a>. You can find the 2015 contest <a href="problems.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<h1 id="physical-chemistry">Physical Chemistry</h1>
<h2 id="part-a">Part A</h2>
<p>We simply sum the reactions, noting that the chlorine and hypochlorite radicals cancel out because they appear as both products and reagants in equal ratio. <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
    \ce{O3 + O -&gt; 2O2}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<h2 id="part-b">Part B</h2>
<p>Chlorine atoms are used as a reagant in the first step and regenerated as a product in the second step, and so they act as a catalyst.</p>
<h2 id="part-c">Part C</h2>
<p>Comparing the second and third row reveals that, when <span class="math inline">\(\ce{[Cl]}\)</span> is relatively constant and <span class="math inline">\(\ce{[O3]}\)</span> just about doubles, the rate also just about doubles. In other words, the reaction is first order with respect to ozone. From the first row to the second row, <span class="math inline">\(\ce{[Cl]}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\ce{[O3]}\)</span> both doubl, and the rate quadruples. This implies that the reaction is first order with respect to chlorine. And so the rate expression for this reaction is <span class="math inline">\(k\ce{[Cl]}\ce{[O3]}\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="part-d">Part D</h2>
<p>We use the data from the first row. <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \text{Rate} &amp;= k\ce{[Cl]}\ce{[O3]} \\
        4.75 \times 10^{10} &amp;= k(4.80 \times 10^{11})(8.22 \times 10^9) \\
        k &amp;= \frac{4.75 \times 10^{10}}{(4.80 \times 10^{11})(8.22 \times 10^9)} \\
        k &amp;= 1.20 \times 10^{-11}.
    \end{split}
\end{equation}\]</span> The units of rate are <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{mol}\,\mathrm{L}^{-1}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\)</span>, and so the units of our expression for <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> are <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
        \frac{\mathrm{mol}\,\mathrm{L}^{-1}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{(\mathrm{mol}\,\mathrm{L}^{-1})(\mathrm{mol}\,\mathrm{L}^{-1})} = \frac{\mathrm{mol}\,\mathrm{L}^{-1}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{\mathrm{mol}^2\,\mathrm{L}^{-2}} = \mathrm{mol}^{-1}\,\mathrm{L}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}.
\end{equation}\]</span> Thus the rate constant is <span class="math inline">\(k = 1.20 \times 10^{-11} \,\mathrm{L}\,\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="part-e">Part E</h2>
<p>We recall the Arrhenius equation, which relates the rate constant <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and the activation energy <span class="math inline">\(E_a\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
    k = Ae^{-\frac{E_a}{RT}}.
\end{equation}\]</span> Here <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is an experimentally determined constant which describes the frequency of collisions during the reaction. However, we do not need its value because we have data for this reaction at two temperatures. We have <span class="math inline">\(k_{200} = 0.66k_{298}\)</span>. And so we have <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \frac{Ae^{-\frac{E_a}{R\cdot200}}}{Ae^{-\frac{E_a}{R\cdot298}}} &amp;= 0.66 \\
        e^{\frac{E_a}{R}\left(\frac{1}{298} - \frac{1}{200}\right)} &amp;= 0.66 \\
        \frac{E_a}{R}\left(\frac{1}{298} - \frac{1}{200}\right) &amp;= \ln 0.66 \\
        E_a &amp;= \frac{R\ln0.66}{\frac{1}{298} - \frac{1}{200}} \\
        E_a &amp;= \frac{8.31451\ln0.66}{\frac{1}{298} - \frac{1}{200}} \\
        E_a &amp;= 2101.08 \\
        E_a &amp;= 2100.
    \end{split}
\end{equation}\]</span> And so we have that the activation energy for this reaction is <span class="math inline">\(2.1\,\mathrm{kJ}\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="part-f">Part F</h2>
<p>We know the presence of chlorine induces a two-step process, so the catalyzed reaction pathway should have two humps. This limits our choices to (i) and (iv). In (i), the presence of chlorine changes the change in enthalpy of the reaction; but this cannot be the case, as the products and reagants (and their enthalpies) are the same in both pathways, and so the change in enthalpy is not affected. Part (iv) correctly represents this idea, and so it is our answer.</p>
<h2 id="part-g">Part G</h2>
<p>We know how to predict the wavelength of light given its energy, with the Planck&ndash;Einstein relation and the wave equation <span class="math inline">\(v = \nu\lambda\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        E &amp;= h\nu \\
        E &amp;= \frac{hc}{\lambda} \\
        \lambda &amp;= \frac{hc}{E}.
    \end{split}
    \label{lambda-e}
\end{equation}\]</span> We then note the relationship between coulombs (charge) and joules (energy). A volt is one joule per coulomb, and by definition, an electron volt is the amount of energy gained (or lost) by the charge of one electron moving across an electric potential difference of one volt. And so we multiply by the charge of the electron, finding that <span class="math inline">\(1\,\mathrm{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{19}\,\mathrm{J}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now we can use <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{lambda-e}\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \lambda &amp;= \frac{(6.62608 \times 10^{-34})(2.997925 \times 10^8)}{9.0(1.602 \times 10^{19})} \\
        &amp;= 1.4 \times 10^{-7}
        &amp;= 140 \,\mathrm{nm}.
    \end{split} 
\end{equation}\]</span> And so we conclude that this transition produces a wavelength of <span class="math inline">\(140 \,\mathrm{nm}\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="part-h">Part H</h2>
<figure>
<img alt="The Lewis structure of oxygen gas." src="../../figures/oxygen.png" style="width:25.0%"/><figcaption>The Lewis structure of oxygen gas.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Oxygen gas has bond order 2, while ozone has bond order 1.5. This implies that oxygen gas has stronger bonds.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="The Lewis structure of oxygen gas." src="../../figures/o3-resonance.png" style="width:30.0%"/><figcaption>The Lewis structure of oxygen gas.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This agrees with the given data; light with shorter wavelengths have more energy, and it takes light of a shorter wavelength for oxygen gas to undergo photolysis.</p>
<h1 id="inorganic-chemistry_1">Inorganic Chemistry</h1>
<h2 id="part-a-1">Part A</h2>
<p>Looking at a periodic table, we note that elemental sulfur has four <span class="math inline">\(3\text{p}\)</span> electrons. Therefore, sulfide, or <span class="math inline">\(\ce{S^{2-}}\)</span> will have six such electrons. And so the electron configuration of sulfide is <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
    1\text{s}^2 2\text{s}^2 2\text{p}^6 3\text{s}^2 3\text{p}^6
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<h2 id="part-b-1">Part B</h2>
<p>Lithium, being an alkali metal, will have oxidation number <span class="math inline">\(1+\)</span>, and sulfide will have an oxidation number equivalent to its charge, <span class="math inline">\(2-\)</span>. Then because lithium iron disulfide is a neutral molecule, iron must have an oxidation number of <span class="math inline">\(-(2\cdot1 - 2\cdot2) = -(-2) = 2\)</span>. And so iron has an oxidation number of <span class="math inline">\(2+\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="part-c-1">Part C</h2>
<p>We have the unbalanced reaction <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
    \ce{Li + Li2FeS2 -&gt; Fe + Li2S}
\end{equation}\]</span> which we balance as <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
    \ce{2Li + Li2FeS2 -&gt; Fe + 2Li2S}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<h2 id="part-d-1">Part D</h2>
<p>Iron (II) turns into elemental iron, which has oxidation number 0, by the process of reduction.</p>
<h2 id="part-e-1">Part E</h2>
<p>There are eight sulfur-sulfur bonds in <span class="math inline">\(\ce{S8}\)</span>. And so to decompose <span class="math inline">\(\ce{S8}\)</span> into eight sulfur atoms requires the breaking of eight sulfur-sulfur bonds. Furthermore, changing the state of these atoms from the solid to gaseous phase reqires an energy equivalent to the enthalpy of sublimation. This means that <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \Delta H^\circ = 8 * 266 + 100 = 2228.
    \end{split}
\end{equation}\]</span> And so the enthalpy change for this transformation is <span class="math inline">\(+2228\,\mathrm{kJ}\,\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="part-f-1">Part F</h2>
<p>The diagram reveals that pyrite has a face-centered cubic structure. There are six faces, each of which contain half of an iron atom, and eight corners, each of which contain an eighth of an iron atom. This means that there are four iron atoms in the unit cell. Pyrite, or iron (II) disulfide, has chemical formula <span class="math inline">\(\ce{FeS2}\)</span>. And so there must be twice as many sulfur atoms as iron atoms. We conclude that each unit cell contains four iron atoms and eight sulfur atoms.</p>
<h2 id="part-g-1">Part G</h2>
<p>Around sulfur, all bond angles are about <span class="math inline">\(109.5^\circ\)</span>, and around iron they are all <span class="math inline">\(90^\circ\)</span>.</p>

<h2 id="part-a-2">Part A</h2>
<p>Norethindrone has six chirality centres, and its alkene is in the E configuration.</p>
<h2 id="part-b-2">Part B</h2>
<p>Norethindrone has four rings and four pi bonds, so its degree of unsaturation is eight.</p>
<h2 id="part-c-2">Part C</h2>
<p>Norethindrone has an alkene, alkyne, ketone, and alcohol.</p>
<h2 id="part-d-2">Part D</h2>
<figure>
<img alt="The synthesis of compound B from compound A." src="../../figures/2015-reaction-scheme.png"/><figcaption>The synthesis of compound B from compound A.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the transformation from A to B, a carbonyl group is turned into a tertiary alcohol. This indicates the use of a reaction involving an organometallic reagant, such as a Grignard reagant. However, this is not sufficient. The Grignard reagant would also attack the alcohol, which would not give us the desired product. Thus we need to protect the alcohol; an ideal choice is trimethylsilyl chloride, which can be added in the presence of base (to neturalize the hydrochloric acid produced) to form a trimethylsilyl ether. Then the Grignard step can be performed. Finally, the trimethylsilyl group can be removed with an excess of strong acid, which coincides perfectly with the workup step required to protonate the alkoxide after nucleophilic addition by the Grignard reagant. To answer the second part of the question, pyridinium chlorochromate (often abbreviated PCC) is a reducing agent; it will transform the ketone to an alcohol.</p>
<figure>

<h2 id="part-e-2">Part E</h2>
<figure>
<img alt="A labelled structure of compound B." src="../../figures/2015-labelled-B.png"/><figcaption>A labelled structure of compound B.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The presence of heat and relatively strong acid could induce the formation of an alkene. Both alcohols are either secondary or tertiary, and so this reaction proceeds by an E1 mechanism; acid protonates the alcohol, which leaves as water and forms a carbocation intermediate. This means that alkene 1-2 or 2-3 could be formed. The secondary carbocation formed at carbon 6 is less stable than a possible tertiary one at carbon 5, so an alkyl shift is likely. This means an alkene could be formed at 4-5 or 5-6 with carbon 6 tertiary, or at 6-7 with carbon 5 quaternary.</p>
<p>However, another pathway is possible. The phosphoric acid could undergo esterification by the alcohol, forming a phosphate ester. This class of reaction is rather complicated, because there are two alcohol groups on compound B, and phospate can be attacked at up to three different sites, so many different products are formed; esters, diesters, and triesters at both carbon 2 and 6.</p>
<p>In reality, all of these products are competing. In both classes of reaction (elimination and esterification), water is produced as a byproduct; it evaporates due to the heat, which drives the reaction to completion. Because the question only asks for one possible product, all of these are possible answers.</p>
