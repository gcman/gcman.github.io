      <description>Problem Statement The number 197 is called a circular prime because all rotations of the digits (197,719,917) are prime. There are thirteen such prime under 100: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97. What is the sum of all circular primes less than \(N\)?
My Algorithm A permutation of a number \(n\) cannot be greater than the smallest power of 10 that is at least \(n\).</description>

      <description>Problem Statement The decimal number \(65 = 1001001001_2\) is palindromic in both decimal and binary. Find the sum of all natural numers less than \(N\) which are palindromic in base 10 and base \(K\).
My Algorithm We need two things to solve this problem: a way to convert a number from base 10 to base \(K\) and a way to generate palindromes. First, let&amp;rsquo;s think about how numbers are written in base 10.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement You are given around five-thousand names. Begin by sorting them by alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value of each name, multiply this value by the alphabetical position of the name in the list. For example, suppose COLIN is the 983rd element of a sorted list of names. It is worth \(3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53\), so this name has a score of \(53 \cdot 983 = 49714\).</description>

      <title>Project Euler 13: Large Sum</title>

      <description>Problem Statement Find the first ten digits of the sum of \(N\) 50-digit numbers.
My Algorithm Thanks to Python&amp;rsquo;s built-in ability to handle infinitely large integers, this problem is a piece of cake. We read in the numbers, add them, convert the result to a string, and output the first ten characters.
Other Solutions In languages without big integer support, we would need an algorithm to add big integers, using string arrays and the carrying method often taught in elementary schools.</description>
