      <description>Every triangle can be circumscribed by a circle, because a circle can always be drawn through three given points, so long as they are not colinear. In fact, every triangle also has a circle that is inscribed in it. These two circles are called the triangle&amp;rsquo;s circumcircle and incircle. Finding these circles for a triangle is simple if the triangle is equilateral, a bit harder if it is right-angled, and a bit harder still if it is not.</description>
