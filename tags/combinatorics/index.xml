      <title>Project Euler 85: Counting Rectangles</title>

      <description>Problem Statement A \(3\)-by-\(2\) rectangular grid contains eighteen rectangles.
Given \(N\), consider all rectangular grids such that the number of rectangles in the grid is nearest to \(N\). Out of all such rectangular grids, return the area of the grid with the largest area.
My Algorithm The first thing we need is a way to count the number of rectangles contained within an \(n\)-by-\(m\) grid. Choosing a subrectangle is equivalent to choosing two vertical and two horizontal lines to cut out a rectangle.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement How many, not necessarily distinct, values of \(\binom{n}{r}\), for \(n \le N\), are greater than \(K\)?
My Algorithm A brute-force search is too slow. And so we exploit the symmetry of Pascal&amp;rsquo;s triangle, which contains the binomial coefficients. Because \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}\), we need only check up to \(\frac{n}{2}\). Furthermore, if \(\binom{n}{k}\) is the first value greater than \(K\), then because the entries of Pascal&amp;rsquo;s triangle strictly increase until the central term, all the entries between \(k\) and \(n-k\), inclusive, will be greater than \(K\).</description>

      <description>Problem Statement The five-digit number \(16807 = 7^5\) is also a fifth power. Given \(N\), find the $N$-digit positive integers that are also an $N$-th power.
My Algorithm An $n$-digit $n$-th power has $n$-th root at most 9, because \(10^n\) is an $(n+1)$-digit number. If \(a^n\) is an $n$-digit number, then unless \(a = 9\), we also have that \((a+1)^n\) is an $n$-digit number. We must find the lowest \(a\) such that \(a^n\) has \(n\) digits.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement We shall say that an $N$-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to \(N\) exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number 15234 is 1 through 5 pandigital. The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity \(39 \cdot 186 = 7254\) containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital. Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through \(N\) pandigital.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement We shall say that an $n$-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to \(n\) exactly once. For example, 2143 is a 4-digit pandigital and is also prime. What is the largest pandigital prime less than or equal to \(N\)? If there is none, return \(-1\).
My Algorithm The sum of digits of an $n$-digit number is the sum of the first \(n\) positive integers, or \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\).</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Surprisingly, there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:
\begin{equation*} \begin{split} 1634 &amp;amp;= 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4 \\
8208 &amp;amp;= 8^4 + 2^4 + 0^4 + 8^4 \\
9474 &amp;amp;= 9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4 \end{split} \end{equation*}
Note that because \(1 = 1^4\) is not a sum, it is not included. The sum of these numbers is \(11634 + 8208 + 9474 = 9316\).</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Suppose we start at the top-left corner of an \(N\times M\) grid and that we can only travel to the right or down. How many routes are there to the bottom-right corner? Output the answer modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
My Algorithm In total, we must make \(N+M\) moves, of which \(N\) are to the right. Choosing these \(N\) moves uniquely identifies each possible route, as this is equivalent to choosing the \(M\) downwards moves.</description>

      <title>Prime Reciprocals Diverge!</title>

      <description>Introduction In this post, we will investigate the infinite series
\begin{equation} \sum_{p} \frac{1}{p}, \end{equation}
taken over all primes \(p\). In particular, we will show that this series diverges.
Calculus and the Prime Number Theorem First, we&amp;rsquo;ll show that this problem falls to the incredible might of the following inequalty, which bounds the value of the $n$-th prime:
\begin{equation} n\log n - n \log\log n \le p_n \le n\log n + n\log\log n \quad (n &amp;gt; 5) \end{equation}</description>

      <title>Relatively Prime, Relatively Often</title>

      <description>Say you choose two integers. What&amp;rsquo;s the chance that they&amp;rsquo;re coprime? My intuition says that it can&amp;rsquo;t be more than one-half, because half of all numbers share a factor of 2. But I&amp;rsquo;m thoroughly wrong here. The probability is actually \(\frac{6}{\pi^2}\), which is about \(61\%\).
We wish to find the probability that two randomly selected integers \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime. If this is true, then \(\mathrm{gcd}(m,n) = 1\). Let&amp;rsquo;s say that \(p = \mathrm{P}(\mathrm{gcd}(m,n)=1)\).</description>

      <title>Harmonic Numbers and Binomial Coefficients</title>

      <description>The $n$-th harmonic number is defined as the sum of reciprocals of the first \(n\) natural numbers:
\begin{equation} \sum\limits_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k}. \end{equation}
We wish to prove the following identity involving harmonic numbers and binomial coefficients:
\begin{equation} \sum\limits_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k} = -\sum\limits_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k}\binom{n}{k}(-1)^k. \label{identity} \end{equation}
I have two solutions: one with calculus, and one by induction.
Calculus First, we notice that
\begin{equation} \int_0^1 x^{k-1} \d x = \frac{x^k}{k} \Biggr\rvert_0^1 = \frac{1}{k} - \frac{0}{k} = \frac{1}{k}.</description>
