      <description>Problem Statement The first two consecutive numbers to have distinct prime factors are \(14 = 2\cdot7\) and \(15 = 3\cdot5\). The first three consecutive such numbers are
\begin{equation*} \begin{split} 644 &amp;amp;= 2^2 \cdot 7 \cdot 23,\\
645 &amp;amp;= 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 43,\\
646 &amp;amp;= 2 \cdot 17 \cdot 19 \end{split} \end{equation*}
Find all the sets of \(K\) consecutive integers (whose first integer is less than \(N\)) that each have exactly \(K\) distinct prime factors.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Starting with 1 and spiralling clockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.
  Figure 1: A 7-by-7 number spiral.
  It is interesting to note that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of \(\frac{8}{13} \approx 62\%\). If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement The number 197 is called a circular prime because all rotations of the digits (197,719,917) are prime. There are thirteen such prime under 100: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97. What is the sum of all circular primes less than \(N\)?

      <description>Problem Statement The number 3797 has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it is possible to continuously remove digits from left to right, and remain prime at each stage: 3797, 797, 97, 7. Similarly, we can remove digits from right to left: 3797, 379, 37, 3. Find the sum of primes that are truncatable from left to right and right to left less than \(N\).
My Algorithm A prime is greater than all of its truncations.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement We shall say that an $n$-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to \(n\) exactly once. For example, 2143 is a 4-digit pandigital and is also prime. What is the largest pandigital prime less than or equal to \(N\)? If there is none, return \(-1\).
My Algorithm The sum of digits of an $n$-digit number is the sum of the first \(n\) positive integers, or \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\).</description>

      <description>Problem Statement It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square. It turns out that the conjecture was false. How many ways can a given \(N\) be represented as the sum of a prime and twice a square?
My Algorithm Suppose an odd composite number \(n\) and a prime \(p\) provide a match. Then \(n = p + 2k^2\) for some positive integer \(k\).</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction, a 5-by-5 spiral is formed:
  Figure 1: A 5-by-5 number spiral. The diagonal entries are bolded.
  It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101. What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in an \(N \times N\) spiral (\(N\) odd)? Report your answer modulo \(10^9 + 7\).</description>

      <description>Problem Statement The sum of all primes below 10 is \(2+3+5+7 = 17\). Find the sum of all primes at most \(N\).
My Algorithm We use a Sieve of Eratosthenes to compute the primes up to the maximum possible value of \(N\). We then construct a prefix sum array in \(O(\frac{N}{\log N})\) time. Using a binary search, we find the index of largest prime less than \(N\) in \(O(\log N - \log \log N)\) time.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28\). The first ten terms would be:
\begin{equation*} 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55,\ldots \end{equation*}
What is the value of the first triangle number to have over \(N\) divisors?

      <description>Problem Statement The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29. What is the largest prime factor of a given number \(N\)?
My Algorithm Splitting \(n\) into two factors gives one at least \(\sqrt{n}\) and one at most \(\sqrt{n}\). To see this, suppose not; if both were strictly less than \(\sqrt{n}\), then their product would be strictly less than \(n\), and if both were strictly greater, so would their product.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to \(N\)?
My Algorithm For a number \(a\) to divide another number \(b\), each of the prime powers that divide \(a\) must also divide \(b\). That is, the exponent on each of the prime powers that divide \(a\) is less than or equal to the corresponding exponent on a prime power that divides \(b\).</description>

      <description>Problem Statement By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13. What is the $N$-th prime number?
My Algorithm We use the following identity, which is a consequence of the Prime Number Theorem:
\begin{equation} n(\log n + \log \log n - 1) &amp;lt; p_n &amp;lt; n(\log n + \log \log n), n &amp;gt; 5. \end{equation}</description>

      <description>Introduction In this post, we will investigate the infinite series
\begin{equation} \sum_{p} \frac{1}{p}, \end{equation}
taken over all primes \(p\). In particular, we will show that this series diverges.
Calculus and the Prime Number Theorem First, we&amp;rsquo;ll show that this problem falls to the incredible might of the following inequalty, which bounds the value of the $n$-th prime:
\begin{equation} n\log n - n \log\log n \le p_n \le n\log n + n\log\log n \quad (n &amp;gt; 5) \end{equation}</description>

      <title>Relatively Prime, Relatively Often</title>
      <link>https://gautammanohar.com/coprime-prob/</link>

      <description>Say you choose two integers. What&amp;rsquo;s the chance that they&amp;rsquo;re coprime? My intuition says that it can&amp;rsquo;t be more than one-half, because half of all numbers share a factor of 2. But I&amp;rsquo;m thoroughly wrong here. The probability is actually \(\frac{6}{\pi^2}\), which is about \(61\%\).
We wish to find the probability that two randomly selected integers \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime. If this is true, then \(\mathrm{gcd}(m,n) = 1\). Let&amp;rsquo;s say that \(p = \mathrm{P}(\mathrm{gcd}(m,n)=1)\).</description>
