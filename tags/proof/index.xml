      <description>Problem Statement For how many values \(P \le N\) is there exactly one way to form a right triangle with integer side lengths and perimeter \(P\)?
My Algorithm See my solution to Project Euler 39, as the techniques I use there are exactly the ones I use for this problem. The only difference is that we count only &amp;ldquo;singular&amp;rdquo; values of \(P\), and we binary search on the index of the greatest value up to \(N\).</description>

      <description>Problem Statement The fraction \(\frac{a}{b}\) is called a reduced proper fraction if \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers with \(a &amp;lt; b\) and \(\mathrm{gcd}(a,b) = 1\). If we list the reduced proper fractions for \(b \le 8\) in increasing order, we get
\begin{equation*} \frac18, \frac17, \frac16, \frac15, \frac14, \frac27, \frac13, \frac38, \frac25, \frac37, \frac12, \frac47, \frac35, \frac58, \frac23, \frac57, \frac34, \frac45, \frac56, \frac67, \frac78 \end{equation*}
How many elements are contained in the set of reduced proper fractions with denominator at most \(N\)?</description>

It can be seen that \(\frac25\) is the fraction immediately to the left of \(\frac37\).</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Pentagonal numbers are given by the formula
\begin{equation*} P_n = \frac{n(3n-1)}{2}. \end{equation*}
The first ten pentagonal numbers are
\begin{equation} 1,5,12,22,35,51,70,92,117,145,\ldots \end{equation}
It can be seen that \(P_4 + P_7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P_8\). Also, \(P_7 - P_5 = 70 - 35 = 35 = P_5\) is also pentagonal. Generalizing for a given \(k\), find all \(P_n\), where \(n &amp;lt; N\), such that at least one of \(P_n \pm P_{n-k}\) is pentagonal.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement It is possible to show that \(\sqrt{2}\) has the following infinite continued fraction expansion:
\begin{equation*} \sqrt{2} = 1 + \frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{2 + \frac{1}{2 + \cdots}}} \end{equation*}
By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get the convergents of \(\sqrt{2}\)
\begin{equation*} \begin{split} 1 + \frac{1}{2} &amp;amp;= \frac{3}{2} \\
1 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{1}{2}} &amp;amp;= \frac{7}{5} \\
1 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{1}{2}}} &amp;amp;= \frac{17}{12} \\
1 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{1}{2}}}} &amp;amp;= \frac{41}{29}.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement The five-digit number \(16807 = 7^5\) is also a fifth power. Given \(N\), find the $N$-digit positive integers that are also an $N$-th power.
My Algorithm An $n$-digit $n$-th power has $n$-th root at most 9, because \(10^n\) is an $(n+1)$-digit number. If \(a^n\) is an $n$-digit number, then unless \(a = 9\), we also have that \((a+1)^n\) is an $n$-digit number. We must find the lowest \(a\) such that \(a^n\) has \(n\) digits.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement The constant \(e\) can be written as the infinite continued fraction \([2;1,2,1,\,1,4,1,\,1,6,1,\ldots,1,2k,\ldots]\). Find the sum of the digits in the $N$-th convergent of the continued fraction expansion for \(e\).
A Recurrence Relation We will show the following theorem. Let the the $n$-th convergent of a continued fraction \([a_0;a_1,a_2,\ldots]\) be \(\frac{P_n}{Q_n}\). Then the $(n+1)$-th convergent is
\begin{equation} \frac{a_{n+1}P_n + P_{n-1}}{a_{n+1}Q_{n} + Q_{n-1}}. \end{equation}
We use induction. Because the 0-th convergent is \(a_0\), we define \(P_0 = a_0, Q_0 = 1\).</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Euler&amp;rsquo;s totient function, \(\varphi(n)\), counts the number of positive integers less than \(n\) that are coprime to \(n\).
  Figure 1: Note that 6 produces a maximum for the desired ratio in the range of this table.
  Given \(N\), find the smallest value \(n&amp;lt;N\) such that \(\frac{n}{\varphi(n)}\) achieves a maximum.
My Algorithm We use Euler&amp;rsquo;s product formula for the totient function,
\begin{equation} \varphi(n) = n\prod\limits_{p|n}\left(1 - \frac{1}{p}\right), \end{equation}</description>

      <description>Problem Statement If \(p\) is the perimeter of a right triangle with side lengths \({a,b,c}\), then there are exactly 3 solutions for \(p = 120\):
\begin{equation*} {20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50} \end{equation*}
For which value of \(p \le N\) is the number of solutions maximized? If there are multiple possible answers, print the minimum one.
My Algorithm A famous method of generating Pythagorean triples is due to Euclid:
\begin{equation} a = m^2 - n^2 \quad b = 2mn \quad c = m^2 + n^2 \quad m &amp;gt; n \label{generating} \end{equation}</description>

      <description>Problem Statement The $n$-th term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by \(t_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\); so the first ten triangle numbers are
\begin{equation*} 1,3,6,10,15,21,28,36,45,55,\ldots \end{equation*}
By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is \(19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t_{10}\). You are given a file words.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square. It turns out that the conjecture was false. How many ways can a given \(N\) be represented as the sum of a prime and twice a square?
My Algorithm Suppose an odd composite number \(n\) and a prime \(p\) provide a match. Then \(n = p + 2k^2\) for some positive integer \(k\).</description>

      <description>Problem Statement A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, \(\mathrm{dabc}\) is a permutation of the word \(\mathrm{abcd}\). If the permutations are listed alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order. The lexicographic permutations of \(\mathrm{abc}\) are:
\begin{equation*} \mathrm{abc}, \mathrm{acb}, \mathrm{bac}, \mathrm{bca}, \mathrm{cab}, \mathrm{cba}. \end{equation*}
What is the $N$-th lexicographic permutation of the word \(\mathrm{abcdefghijklm}\)?
My Algorithm Suppose our word has \(n\) letters. Then the first \((n-1)!\) lexicographic permutations begin with \(a\), the next \((n-1)!</description>

      <description>Problem Statement What is the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain \(N\) digits?
My Algorithm We will use Binet&amp;rsquo;s formula for the $n$-th fibonacci number
\begin{equation} F_n = \frac{\varphi^n - (-\varphi)^{-n}}{\sqrt{5}}. \end{equation}
The \((-\varphi)^{-n}\) quickly becomes negligible. So we can make the approximation
\begin{equation} F_n \approx \frac{\varphi^n}{\sqrt{5}}. \label{approx} \end{equation}
A number \(n\) has \(\lfloor \log_{10} n \rfloor + 1\) digits. So we must solve the following equation such that \(n\) is minimized:</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Suppose we start at the top-left corner of an \(N\times M\) grid and that we can only travel to the right or down. How many routes are there to the bottom-right corner? Output the answer modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
My Algorithm In total, we must make \(N+M\) moves, of which \(N\) are to the right. Choosing these \(N\) moves uniquely identifies each possible route, as this is equivalent to choosing the \(M\) downwards moves.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28\). The first ten terms would be:
\begin{equation*} 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55,\ldots \end{equation*}

      <description>Problem Statement A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, \(a &amp;lt; b &amp;lt; c\), for which,
\begin{equation*} a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \end{equation*}
For example, \(3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52\). Given \(N\), find the maximal product \(abc\) such that \(a,b,c\) form a Pythagorean triplet for which \(a+b+c = N\). If no such triplet exists, output \(-1\).

      <description>Introduction In this post, we will investigate the infinite series
\begin{equation} \sum_{p} \frac{1}{p}, \end{equation}
taken over all primes \(p\). In particular, we will show that this series diverges.
Calculus and the Prime Number Theorem First, we&amp;rsquo;ll show that this problem falls to the incredible might of the following inequalty, which bounds the value of the $n$-th prime:
\begin{equation} n\log n - n \log\log n \le p_n \le n\log n + n\log\log n \quad (n &amp;gt; 5) \end{equation}</description>

      <description>Say you choose two integers. What&amp;rsquo;s the chance that they&amp;rsquo;re coprime? My intuition says that it can&amp;rsquo;t be more than one-half, because half of all numbers share a factor of 2. But I&amp;rsquo;m thoroughly wrong here. The probability is actually \(\frac{6}{\pi^2}\), which is about \(61\%\).
We wish to find the probability that two randomly selected integers \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime. If this is true, then \(\mathrm{gcd}(m,n) = 1\). Let&amp;rsquo;s say that \(p = \mathrm{P}(\mathrm{gcd}(m,n)=1)\).</description>

      <description>Every triangle can be circumscribed by a circle, because a circle can always be drawn through three given points, so long as they are not colinear. In fact, every triangle also has a circle that is inscribed in it. These two circles are called the triangle&amp;rsquo;s circumcircle and incircle. Finding these circles for a triangle is simple if the triangle is equilateral, a bit harder if it is right-angled, and a bit harder still if it is not.</description>

      <description>One of my favourite formulas in mathematics is the one for the area of a circle, \(\pi r^2\). Its simplicity intrigued my young mind; the circle is, in a sense, the simplest, the roundest shape, and this formula seems to encapsulate the circle&amp;rsquo;s aura of &amp;ldquo;completion.&amp;rdquo; As I grew older, I learned more such formulas for the volumes and surface areas of familiar geometric objects. In particular, I learned of the formula for the volume of a sphere \(\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\).</description>

      <description>The $n$-th harmonic number is defined as the sum of reciprocals of the first \(n\) natural numbers:
\begin{equation} \sum\limits_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k}. \end{equation}
We wish to prove the following identity involving harmonic numbers and binomial coefficients:
\begin{equation} \sum\limits_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k} = -\sum\limits_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k}\binom{n}{k}(-1)^k. \label{identity} \end{equation}
I have two solutions: one with calculus, and one by induction.
Calculus First, we notice that
\begin{equation} \int_0^1 x^{k-1} \d x = \frac{x^k}{k} \Biggr\rvert_0^1 = \frac{1}{k} - \frac{0}{k} = \frac{1}{k}.</description>

      <description>A well-known fact in Euclidean geometry is the following expression for the area of a triangle given its side lengths:
\begin{equation} A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}, \end{equation}
where \(s\) is the semiperimeter of the triangle, \(\frac{a+b+c}{2}\). Our goal is to generalize this formula to quadrilaterals. Just like in proofs of Heron&amp;rsquo;s formula that use trigonometry, we will use the formula for the area of a triangle
\begin{equation} A = \frac{1}{2}ab\sin C \end{equation}</description>

      <description>The constants \(e\) and \(\pi\) are everywhere in mathematics. Determining the greater of the two expressions \(e^\pi\) and \(\pi^e\) (without using a calculator, of course&amp;hellip;) is a fun puzzle that you can approach in many ways. I&amp;rsquo;d like to discuss my solutions.
Differentiation We shall perform the same operations on the two expressions.
\begin{equation} \begin{split} e^{\pi} &amp;amp;\odot \pi^e \\
e^{\frac{\pi}{e}} &amp;amp;\odot \pi^{\frac{e}{e}} \\
e^{\frac{1}{e}} &amp;amp;\odot \pi^{\frac{1}{\pi}} \end{split} \end{equation}
To show that \(e^\pi &amp;gt; \pi^e\), it suffices to show that \(e^{\frac{1}{e}} &amp;gt; \pi^{\frac{1}{\pi}}\).</description>
