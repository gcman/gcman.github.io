      <description>Problem Statement A \(3\)-by-\(2\) rectangular grid contains eighteen rectangles.
Given \(N\), consider all rectangular grids such that the number of rectangles in the grid is nearest to \(N\). Out of all such rectangular grids, return the area of the grid with the largest area.
My Algorithm The first thing we need is a way to count the number of rectangles contained within an \(n\)-by-\(m\) grid. Choosing a subrectangle is equivalent to choosing two vertical and two horizontal lines to cut out a rectangle.</description>

      <title>Project Euler 94: Almost Equilateral Triangles</title>

      <description>Problem Statement It is easily proved that there exists no equilateral triangle with integral side lengths and integral area. Define an almost equilateral triangle as an isoceles triangle in which the third side length differs from the others by one. Some almost equilateral triangles have an integral area. One example is \((5,5,6)\) which has an area of 12.
Find the sum of the perimeters of all almost equilateral triangles with integral side lengths and integral area whose perimeters are at most \(N\).</description>

      <title>Project Euler 65: Convergents of $e$</title>

      <description>Problem Statement The constant \(e\) can be written as the infinite continued fraction \([2;1,2,1,\,1,4,1,\,1,6,1,\ldots,1,2k,\ldots]\). Find the sum of the digits in the $N$-th convergent of the continued fraction expansion for \(e\).
A Recurrence Relation We will show the following theorem. Let the the $n$-th convergent of a continued fraction \([a_0;a_1,a_2,\ldots]\) be \(\frac{P_n}{Q_n}\). Then the $(n+1)$-th convergent is
\begin{equation} \frac{a_{n+1}P_n + P_{n-1}}{a_{n+1}Q_{n} + Q_{n-1}}. \end{equation}
We use induction. Because the 0-th convergent is \(a_0\), we define \(P_0 = a_0, Q_0 = 1\).</description>
