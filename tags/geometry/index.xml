      <description>Every triangle can be circumscribed by a circle, because a circle can always be drawn through three given points, so long as they are not colinear. In fact, every triangle also has a circle that is inscribed in it. These two circles are called the triangle&amp;rsquo;s circumcircle and incircle. Finding these circles for a triangle is simple if the triangle is equilateral, a bit harder if it is right-angled, and a bit harder still if it is not.</description>

      <description>One of my favourite formulas in mathematics is the one for the area of a circle, \(\pi r^2\). Its simplicity intrigued my young mind; the circle is, in a sense, the simplest, the roundest shape, and this formula seems to encapsulate the circle&amp;rsquo;s aura of &amp;ldquo;completion.&amp;rdquo; As I grew older, I learned more such formulas for the volumes and surface areas of familiar geometric objects. In particular, I learned of the formula for the volume of a sphere \(\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\).</description>

      <title>Generalizing Heron&#39;s Formula</title>

      <description>A well-known fact in Euclidean geometry is the following expression for the area of a triangle given its side lengths:
\begin{equation} A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}, \end{equation}
where \(s\) is the semiperimeter of the triangle, \(\frac{a+b+c}{2}\). Our goal is to generalize this formula to quadrilaterals. Just like in proofs of Heron&amp;rsquo;s formula that use trigonometry, we will use the formula for the area of a triangle
\begin{equation} A = \frac{1}{2}ab\sin C \end{equation}</description>
